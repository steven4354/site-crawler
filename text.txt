We take pride in our ability to level up the ecommerce brands we acquire. Check out these case studies to see how unique companies all experienced success.
The market for pillows is nightmarishly competitive – exactly why we dreamed up ways to differentiate Snuggle-Pedic from the rest and show customers this premium brand is more than just fluff. Read on to learn how we created a new strategy, increased product visibility, and drove growth and conversions.
We took a commercial-grade product and made it consumer ready, increasing revenue from $2.5 million to $16.5 million. In the process, this brand became so beloved, it expanded beyond Amazon to be sold in retail stores across the country.
Becky Cameron Home went from one successful product to a cohesive brand through expansive creative updates and pay-per-click marketing initiatives for every single product. We increased the brand's Best Sellers Rank by 95% in less than three weeks.
Thrasio grew Crafts 4 All over 3X in just 2 years with vibrant packaging, heavily invested PPC, and an expanded product line. Our secret to maintaining its #1 rank? Never run out of inventory.
ThisWorx was initially a small brand led by one successful product. Thrasio improved search engine optimization, updated the photos and videos, and gave a hefty marketing push to make this brand a runaway success in only a few months.
Thrasio revamped pay-per-click marketing, launched generous customer service initiatives, and brought TrailBuddy into new marketplaces—making this brand a global success.
We acquired Beast Gear 3 months before COVID-19 changed the game for sellers and customers worldwide. Demand for home-fitness gear from Beast Gear spiked – as did demand for competitors’ products.
Thrasio breathed new life into Cloud Massage by giving the brand image a makeover. Then, we rejuvenated the marketing strategy using Amazon Deals, coupons, and pay-per-click advertising – increasing Cloud Massage sales volume and revenue both on Amazon and the brand’s own website.
Our case studies are for general information purposes; they are not guarantees of future performance and undue reliance should not be placed on them. Each case study is based on a particular set of facts and conditions at a point in time and may involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties.

As Thrasio expands, we are committed to growing our global consciousness even faster. Our impact on the environment and the opportunity to lift people up help guide every decision we make.
Through our Responsible Sourcing Program, we partner with amfori, the leading global business association for open and sustainable trade, to implement tools and best practices that evaluate the social performance of our supply chain. Suppliers are committed to follow the amfori code of conduct – 11 principles ranging from fair payments to environmental protection.
As part of our Supply Chain Sustainability initiative, we’ve adopted the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol standard to measure, manage, and report our GHG emissions. We've also partnered with Pathzero to estimate GHG emissions from port-to-port freight operations, following best practices as specified in the Protocol.
To strengthen the communities in which we live and work, we’ve created meaningful, fun, and high-engagement mentorship and philanthropic opportunities.
Thrasio’s fellowship in collaboration with Success Academy (SA) in Harlem offers high school students the opportunity to learn from our employees how to research, build, and scale a social enterprise from scratch. Fellows work in teams and, after a series of workshops, are awarded seed funding to launch a minimum viable product or service in their communities. As Amazon has done for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), we also hope to further democratize entrepreneurship by inspiring students early on to explore their potential as the entrepreneurs of the future.
Being a mentor at BUILD has been a very humbling and eye-opening experience. It is incredible to see the passion that goes into developing a concept into a product that the students are proud of. Working at Thrasio gives me the confidence to tell these students that there is a world that values their entrepreneurial spirits and needs their problem-solving skills.
Being able to give back to my own middle school was an incredible professional accomplishment that’s also very important to me personally. I’m thrilled to be able to impact the communities where I grew up and to potentially introduce new career possibilities for bright young minds.
We encourage Thrashers to utilize our unlimited paid time off policy and take action on issues that are most meaningful to them.
Take off with a group of positive people out to define the future.

Some say fortune favors the brave. Josh and Carlos’ good fortune started when they met while working on a purpose-driven jewelry brand called Bravelets, founded by current Thrasio COO Stephanie Fox. Though the company was initially successful, environmental factors and a lack of resources kept it from growing to its maximum potential. This gave them an idea: What if they could roll up struggling ecommerce companies into one portfolio and use a single set of operators and scalable processes to take them to the next level? Talk about entering a brave new world. Together, they disrupted the 3P marketplace on Amazon and established a category that has gone on to inspire hundreds of competitors.

, your gateway to building a better consumer goods company. Every edition, we’ll share stories, insights, and expertise on a topic critical to the industry. This issue: the importance of quality assurance and making sure the products you deliver truly deliver.
Talk about top shelf. Thrasio’s wildly popular pet odor eliminator spray Angry Orange now can be found at 1,750 Target stores, more than 1,500 PetSmart stores, more than 500 Ace/True Value Hardware stores – and continues to sell like hotcakes on Amazon, Walmart as well as the Angry Orange site. No matter where they shop, customers expect a product that’s best in show. After all, when your furry friend revenge-pees on your rug, you want nothing less than a blue-ribbon solution. That’s why we implement rigorous quality controls right where Angry Orange is made: at Toledo, Ohio-based Chempace Corporation. The result? A product that comes up smelling like roses – or rather oranges – every single time.
At Thrasio, we have quality assurance technicians, chemists, and engineers who continually improve upon products and processes. Why? So when customers try a Thrasio product, they’re delighted with the experience every single time.
Your customers expect the best. Here are 5 steps to build a strong quality assurance program and become more effective at preventing the defective.
Everyone’s been there. You buy a product that you’re excited to use, and then, when you need it, it fails to live up to its claims. Total headache. But for a business owner, one defective item can potentially set off a torrent of torment: a batch that has to be recalled, poor reviews that affect customer acquisition and loyalty, and even additional rounds of production. Fortunately, a strong quality assurance program can save the day, catching defective products before they ever ship to your customers.
If you don’t have a program in place, fear not: Axel Gonzalez has your back. Thrasio’s senior director of quality assurance and sustainability shares 5 steps to get you started.
Take, for example, the premium 10-piece bartender set Thrasio sells through our Mixology & Craft brand. It’s a showpiece with a premium price point. As such, its form can’t have scratches, dirty marks, or any flaws in its shape. Its strainer has to snugly fit inside the shaker so that no liquid leaks, while each piece must also fit in the display stand. And in order to meet Mixology & Craft’s goal of creating delicious cocktails, the shakers need to function as closed vessels that allow you to quickly mix ingredients together while simultaneously chilling the drink. This bartender set needs to bring your dreams of perfect libations to life.
Take some time to think about how form, fit, and function apply to your products. Literally make a list. This is the start of your quality assurance program, how you’ll begin to understand which attributes need to be assessed and tested. Depending on the complexity of your product, it could be a long list. But by clearly identifying what really matters to your products early on, you’ll set yourself up for a smooth operation and strong defense against trouble down the road.
Once you’ve decided what you’re going to test for, you need a resource to guide you through the process. Enter the quality acceptance document.
“The quality acceptance document is essentially the playbook that you will use to carry out your product inspections,” Gonzalez notes.
Picture a playbook for an NFL team. At its most basic, you’ll have your coaching staff and players (or, who’s leading and conducting the testing process), your schedule (how often you test), and your gameplan (how you’ll conduct tests). Instead of using Xs and Os and other visual aids to run your plays, however, you’ll use pictures that help you tell which products will pass a quality check, which will fail, and why. The playbook will also outline the sample sizes you’ll test and define what percentage of defective products will signal the need to reject a whole batch.
Use your written explanation of ideal form, fit, and function to identify what imperfections to test for. These will fall into 1 of 3 categories: minor defect, major defect, or critical defect. For example, a scratch on a cocktail shaker might be considered a minor defect, while a warped shaker that doesn’t fit inside the other shaker could be deemed a critical defect. The amount of defects you find in your sample size will give you an idea about whether you can ship your products, need to do additional testing, or have to – sigh – reject the batch outright.
You can then come up with your own sample sizes and rejection thresholds, but the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) also has a standardized acceptance quality limit (AQL) sampling system for inspection by attributes. The AQL chart can be used to provide information and guidance on inspection levels, rejection thresholds, and sample sizes for individual shipments.
If this seems like a lot, it doesn’t have to be. You don’t want to go it alone when creating a quality acceptance document. Incorporate your supplier into the process.
“It only makes sense that your supplier agrees to everything in the document so that both parties are on the same page in terms of what is and is not acceptable,” Gonzalez says.
By having quality standards clearly laid out and agreed upon ahead of time, you reduce the risk of having a drawn-out dispute with your supplier over an unsatisfactory batch of product.
Striking the right balance on quality assurance can also be tricky. You have to take a bit of a Goldilocks approach with it. Too strict and you run the risk of rejecting too much product, which can lead to delays and stockouts. Too lax and defective products can end up making their way to customers, paving the way for negative reviews. Knowing early on what is realistic for your supplier to achieve from a quality standpoint can save you a lot of time and money down the road.
Oh … and if you’ve never built a quality acceptance document before, no problem.
Templates to help structure your document are available online.
Gonzalez strongly advises against relying on your manufacturer to carry out product inspections on your behalf. “You want an impartial inspector,” he says. “You need to insist on it. Otherwise, you can be left with a supplier who cuts corners when it comes to quality assurance in the hopes of avoiding rejects.” But, Gonzalez adds, there are a few things to keep in mind when looking for a solid third-party inspection company to partner with.
Third-party inspection companies need to be available on short notice. Our partner promises to have an agent on site and ready to conduct an inspection, anywhere in continental Asia, within 24 hours. This kind of flexibility is invaluable, as it minimizes delays across our vast network of suppliers. But even if you only have a few suppliers, if the past 2 years have taught us anything, it’s that unexpected delays and last-minute changes are a fact of life. Knowing that your third-party inspection company has the flexibility to swiftly react to these changes is a huge value-add.
Find an inspection company with top-notch technology platforms that allow you to quickly and easily access all of your inspection reports across your suppliers in real time. That’s especially helpful if you’ve got a lot of suppliers (and thus a lot of inspection reports).
Your third-party inspection company should be aligned with the material in your quality acceptance document. After all, they’ll be the ones carrying out the inspections. In their reports, data should be presented clearly and succinctly, allowing you to make quick, informed decisions on which products are ready to ship. A good inspection report will begin with a summary of the main findings, followed by detailed information to support those assessments. When vetting third-party inspection companies, it’s not a bad idea to ask them for sample reports to get a feel for how they present data.
Schedule inspections as soon as your products come off the line – the sooner the better. Why? That gives you time to course correct if there’s a problem. You don’t want to be caught with insufficient inventory because of extended retesting time frames or full-batch rejections.
There’s no “one size fits all” approach to quality assurance. Every product is unique. Even 2 sellers who sell a similar product may have different ideas about what quality testing should look like. And that’s OK. You’re taking steps that give your products the best chance to arrive on the doorsteps of your customers – exactly how they expect them to be.

We take pride in our ability to level up the ecommerce brands we acquire. Check out these case studies to see how unique companies all experienced success.
The market for pillows is nightmarishly competitive – exactly why we dreamed up ways to differentiate Snuggle-Pedic from the rest and show customers this premium brand is more than just fluff. Read on to learn how we created a new strategy, increased product visibility, and drove growth and conversions.
We took a commercial-grade product and made it consumer ready, increasing revenue from $2.5 million to $16.5 million. In the process, this brand became so beloved, it expanded beyond Amazon to be sold in retail stores across the country.
Becky Cameron Home went from one successful product to a cohesive brand through expansive creative updates and pay-per-click marketing initiatives for every single product. We increased the brand's Best Sellers Rank by 95% in less than three weeks.
Thrasio grew Crafts 4 All over 3X in just 2 years with vibrant packaging, heavily invested PPC, and an expanded product line. Our secret to maintaining its #1 rank? Never run out of inventory.
ThisWorx was initially a small brand led by one successful product. Thrasio improved search engine optimization, updated the photos and videos, and gave a hefty marketing push to make this brand a runaway success in only a few months.
Thrasio revamped pay-per-click marketing, launched generous customer service initiatives, and brought TrailBuddy into new marketplaces—making this brand a global success.
We acquired Beast Gear 3 months before COVID-19 changed the game for sellers and customers worldwide. Demand for home-fitness gear from Beast Gear spiked – as did demand for competitors’ products.
Thrasio breathed new life into Cloud Massage by giving the brand image a makeover. Then, we rejuvenated the marketing strategy using Amazon Deals, coupons, and pay-per-click advertising – increasing Cloud Massage sales volume and revenue both on Amazon and the brand’s own website.
Our case studies are for general information purposes; they are not guarantees of future performance and undue reliance should not be placed on them. Each case study is based on a particular set of facts and conditions at a point in time and may involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. The performance, financial results, and projections for the products or sellers in these case studies may not be parallel in others.

As Thrasio expands, we are committed to growing our global consciousness even faster. Our impact on the environment and the opportunity to lift people up help guide every decision we make.
Through our Responsible Sourcing Program, we partner with amfori, the leading global business association for open and sustainable trade, to implement tools and best practices that evaluate the social performance of our supply chain. Suppliers are committed to follow the amfori code of conduct – 11 principles ranging from fair payments to environmental protection.
As part of our Supply Chain Sustainability initiative, we’ve adopted the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol standard to measure, manage, and report our GHG emissions. We've also partnered with Pathzero to estimate GHG emissions from port-to-port freight operations, following best practices as specified in the Protocol.
To strengthen the communities in which we live and work, we’ve created meaningful, fun, and high-engagement mentorship and philanthropic opportunities.
Thrasio’s fellowship in collaboration with Success Academy (SA) in Harlem offers high school students the opportunity to learn from our employees how to research, build, and scale a social enterprise from scratch. Fellows work in teams and, after a series of workshops, are awarded seed funding to launch a minimum viable product or service in their communities. As Amazon has done for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), we also hope to further democratize entrepreneurship by inspiring students early on to explore their potential as the entrepreneurs of the future.
Being a mentor at BUILD has been a very humbling and eye-opening experience. It is incredible to see the passion that goes into developing a concept into a product that the students are proud of. Working at Thrasio gives me the confidence to tell these students that there is a world that values their entrepreneurial spirits and needs their problem-solving skills.
Being able to give back to my own middle school was an incredible professional accomplishment that’s also very important to me personally. I’m thrilled to be able to impact the communities where I grew up and to potentially introduce new career possibilities for bright young minds.
We encourage Thrashers to utilize our unlimited paid time off policy and take action on issues that are most meaningful to them.
Take off with a group of positive people out to define the future.

Some say fortune favors the brave. Josh and Carlos’ good fortune started when they met while working on a purpose-driven jewelry brand called Bravelets, founded by current Thrasio COO Stephanie Fox. Though the company was initially successful, environmental factors and a lack of resources kept it from growing to its maximum potential. This gave them an idea: What if they could roll up struggling ecommerce companies into one portfolio and use a single set of operators and scalable processes to take them to the next level? Talk about entering a brave new world. Together, they disrupted the 3P marketplace on Amazon and established a category that has gone on to inspire hundreds of competitors.

, your gateway to building a better consumer goods company. Every edition, we’ll share stories, insights, and expertise on a topic critical to the industry. This issue: the importance of quality assurance and making sure the products you deliver truly deliver.
Talk about top shelf. Thrasio’s wildly popular pet odor eliminator spray Angry Orange now can be found at 1,750 Target stores, more than 1,500 PetSmart stores, more than 500 Ace/True Value Hardware stores – and continues to sell like hotcakes on Amazon, Walmart as well as the Angry Orange site. No matter where they shop, customers expect a product that’s best in show. After all, when your furry friend revenge-pees on your rug, you want nothing less than a blue-ribbon solution. That’s why we implement rigorous quality controls right where Angry Orange is made: at Toledo, Ohio-based Chempace Corporation. The result? A product that comes up smelling like roses – or rather oranges – every single time.
At Thrasio, we have quality assurance technicians, chemists, and engineers who continually improve upon products and processes. Why? So when customers try a Thrasio product, they’re delighted with the experience every single time.
Your customers expect the best. Here are 5 steps to build a strong quality assurance program and become more effective at preventing the defective.
Everyone’s been there. You buy a product that you’re excited to use, and then, when you need it, it fails to live up to its claims. Total headache. But for a business owner, one defective item can potentially set off a torrent of torment: a batch that has to be recalled, poor reviews that affect customer acquisition and loyalty, and even additional rounds of production. Fortunately, a strong quality assurance program can save the day, catching defective products before they ever ship to your customers.
If you don’t have a program in place, fear not: Axel Gonzalez has your back. Thrasio’s senior director of quality assurance and sustainability shares 5 steps to get you started.
Take, for example, the premium 10-piece bartender set Thrasio sells through our Mixology & Craft brand. It’s a showpiece with a premium price point. As such, its form can’t have scratches, dirty marks, or any flaws in its shape. Its strainer has to snugly fit inside the shaker so that no liquid leaks, while each piece must also fit in the display stand. And in order to meet Mixology & Craft’s goal of creating delicious cocktails, the shakers need to function as closed vessels that allow you to quickly mix ingredients together while simultaneously chilling the drink. This bartender set needs to bring your dreams of perfect libations to life.
Take some time to think about how form, fit, and function apply to your products. Literally make a list. This is the start of your quality assurance program, how you’ll begin to understand which attributes need to be assessed and tested. Depending on the complexity of your product, it could be a long list. But by clearly identifying what really matters to your products early on, you’ll set yourself up for a smooth operation and strong defense against trouble down the road.
Once you’ve decided what you’re going to test for, you need a resource to guide you through the process. Enter the quality acceptance document.
“The quality acceptance document is essentially the playbook that you will use to carry out your product inspections,” Gonzalez notes.
Picture a playbook for an NFL team. At its most basic, you’ll have your coaching staff and players (or, who’s leading and conducting the testing process), your schedule (how often you test), and your gameplan (how you’ll conduct tests). Instead of using Xs and Os and other visual aids to run your plays, however, you’ll use pictures that help you tell which products will pass a quality check, which will fail, and why. The playbook will also outline the sample sizes you’ll test and define what percentage of defective products will signal the need to reject a whole batch.
Use your written explanation of ideal form, fit, and function to identify what imperfections to test for. These will fall into 1 of 3 categories: minor defect, major defect, or critical defect. For example, a scratch on a cocktail shaker might be considered a minor defect, while a warped shaker that doesn’t fit inside the other shaker could be deemed a critical defect. The amount of defects you find in your sample size will give you an idea about whether you can ship your products, need to do additional testing, or have to – sigh – reject the batch outright.
You can then come up with your own sample sizes and rejection thresholds, but the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) also has a standardized acceptance quality limit (AQL) sampling system for inspection by attributes. The AQL chart can be used to provide information and guidance on inspection levels, rejection thresholds, and sample sizes for individual shipments.
If this seems like a lot, it doesn’t have to be. You don’t want to go it alone when creating a quality acceptance document. Incorporate your supplier into the process.
“It only makes sense that your supplier agrees to everything in the document so that both parties are on the same page in terms of what is and is not acceptable,” Gonzalez says.
By having quality standards clearly laid out and agreed upon ahead of time, you reduce the risk of having a drawn-out dispute with your supplier over an unsatisfactory batch of product.
Striking the right balance on quality assurance can also be tricky. You have to take a bit of a Goldilocks approach with it. Too strict and you run the risk of rejecting too much product, which can lead to delays and stockouts. Too lax and defective products can end up making their way to customers, paving the way for negative reviews. Knowing early on what is realistic for your supplier to achieve from a quality standpoint can save you a lot of time and money down the road.
Oh … and if you’ve never built a quality acceptance document before, no problem.
Templates to help structure your document are available online.
Gonzalez strongly advises against relying on your manufacturer to carry out product inspections on your behalf. “You want an impartial inspector,” he says. “You need to insist on it. Otherwise, you can be left with a supplier who cuts corners when it comes to quality assurance in the hopes of avoiding rejects.” But, Gonzalez adds, there are a few things to keep in mind when looking for a solid third-party inspection company to partner with.
Third-party inspection companies need to be available on short notice. Our partner promises to have an agent on site and ready to conduct an inspection, anywhere in continental Asia, within 24 hours. This kind of flexibility is invaluable, as it minimizes delays across our vast network of suppliers. But even if you only have a few suppliers, if the past 2 years have taught us anything, it’s that unexpected delays and last-minute changes are a fact of life. Knowing that your third-party inspection company has the flexibility to swiftly react to these changes is a huge value-add.
Find an inspection company with top-notch technology platforms that allow you to quickly and easily access all of your inspection reports across your suppliers in real time. That’s especially helpful if you’ve got a lot of suppliers (and thus a lot of inspection reports).
Your third-party inspection company should be aligned with the material in your quality acceptance document. After all, they’ll be the ones carrying out the inspections. In their reports, data should be presented clearly and succinctly, allowing you to make quick, informed decisions on which products are ready to ship. A good inspection report will begin with a summary of the main findings, followed by detailed information to support those assessments. When vetting third-party inspection companies, it’s not a bad idea to ask them for sample reports to get a feel for how they present data.
Schedule inspections as soon as your products come off the line – the sooner the better. Why? That gives you time to course correct if there’s a problem. You don’t want to be caught with insufficient inventory because of extended retesting time frames or full-batch rejections.
There’s no “one size fits all” approach to quality assurance. Every product is unique. Even 2 sellers who sell a similar product may have different ideas about what quality testing should look like. And that’s OK. You’re taking steps that give your products the best chance to arrive on the doorsteps of your customers – exactly how they expect them to be.

As Thrasio expands, we are committed to growing our global consciousness even faster. Our impact on the environment and the opportunity to lift people up help guide every decision we make.
Through our Responsible Sourcing Program, we partner with amfori, the leading global business association for open and sustainable trade, to implement tools and best practices that evaluate the social performance of our supply chain. Suppliers are committed to follow the amfori code of conduct – 11 principles ranging from fair payments to environmental protection.
As part of our Supply Chain Sustainability initiative, we’ve adopted the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol standard to measure, manage, and report our GHG emissions. We've also partnered with Pathzero to estimate GHG emissions from port-to-port freight operations, following best practices as specified in the Protocol.
To strengthen the communities in which we live and work, we’ve created meaningful, fun, and high-engagement mentorship and philanthropic opportunities.
Thrasio’s fellowship in collaboration with Success Academy (SA) in Harlem offers high school students the opportunity to learn from our employees how to research, build, and scale a social enterprise from scratch. Fellows work in teams and, after a series of workshops, are awarded seed funding to launch a minimum viable product or service in their communities. As Amazon has done for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), we also hope to further democratize entrepreneurship by inspiring students early on to explore their potential as the entrepreneurs of the future.
Being a mentor at BUILD has been a very humbling and eye-opening experience. It is incredible to see the passion that goes into developing a concept into a product that the students are proud of. Working at Thrasio gives me the confidence to tell these students that there is a world that values their entrepreneurial spirits and needs their problem-solving skills.
Being able to give back to my own middle school was an incredible professional accomplishment that’s also very important to me personally. I’m thrilled to be able to impact the communities where I grew up and to potentially introduce new career possibilities for bright young minds.
We encourage Thrashers to utilize our unlimited paid time off policy and take action on issues that are most meaningful to them.
Take off with a group of positive people out to define the future.

Some say fortune favors the brave. Josh and Carlos’ good fortune started when they met while working on a purpose-driven jewelry brand called Bravelets, founded by current Thrasio COO Stephanie Fox. Though the company was initially successful, environmental factors and a lack of resources kept it from growing to its maximum potential. This gave them an idea: What if they could roll up struggling ecommerce companies into one portfolio and use a single set of operators and scalable processes to take them to the next level? Talk about entering a brave new world. Together, they disrupted the 3P marketplace on Amazon and established a category that has gone on to inspire hundreds of competitors.

, your gateway to building a better consumer goods company. Every edition, we’ll share stories, insights, and expertise on a topic critical to the industry. This issue: the importance of quality assurance and making sure the products you deliver truly deliver.
Talk about top shelf. Thrasio’s wildly popular pet odor eliminator spray Angry Orange now can be found at 1,750 Target stores, more than 1,500 PetSmart stores, more than 500 Ace/True Value Hardware stores – and continues to sell like hotcakes on Amazon, Walmart as well as the Angry Orange site. No matter where they shop, customers expect a product that’s best in show. After all, when your furry friend revenge-pees on your rug, you want nothing less than a blue-ribbon solution. That’s why we implement rigorous quality controls right where Angry Orange is made: at Toledo, Ohio-based Chempace Corporation. The result? A product that comes up smelling like roses – or rather oranges – every single time.
At Thrasio, we have quality assurance technicians, chemists, and engineers who continually improve upon products and processes. Why? So when customers try a Thrasio product, they’re delighted with the experience every single time.
Your customers expect the best. Here are 5 steps to build a strong quality assurance program and become more effective at preventing the defective.
Everyone’s been there. You buy a product that you’re excited to use, and then, when you need it, it fails to live up to its claims. Total headache. But for a business owner, one defective item can potentially set off a torrent of torment: a batch that has to be recalled, poor reviews that affect customer acquisition and loyalty, and even additional rounds of production. Fortunately, a strong quality assurance program can save the day, catching defective products before they ever ship to your customers.
If you don’t have a program in place, fear not: Axel Gonzalez has your back. Thrasio’s senior director of quality assurance and sustainability shares 5 steps to get you started.
Take, for example, the premium 10-piece bartender set Thrasio sells through our Mixology & Craft brand. It’s a showpiece with a premium price point. As such, its form can’t have scratches, dirty marks, or any flaws in its shape. Its strainer has to snugly fit inside the shaker so that no liquid leaks, while each piece must also fit in the display stand. And in order to meet Mixology & Craft’s goal of creating delicious cocktails, the shakers need to function as closed vessels that allow you to quickly mix ingredients together while simultaneously chilling the drink. This bartender set needs to bring your dreams of perfect libations to life.
Take some time to think about how form, fit, and function apply to your products. Literally make a list. This is the start of your quality assurance program, how you’ll begin to understand which attributes need to be assessed and tested. Depending on the complexity of your product, it could be a long list. But by clearly identifying what really matters to your products early on, you’ll set yourself up for a smooth operation and strong defense against trouble down the road.
Once you’ve decided what you’re going to test for, you need a resource to guide you through the process. Enter the quality acceptance document.
“The quality acceptance document is essentially the playbook that you will use to carry out your product inspections,” Gonzalez notes.
Picture a playbook for an NFL team. At its most basic, you’ll have your coaching staff and players (or, who’s leading and conducting the testing process), your schedule (how often you test), and your gameplan (how you’ll conduct tests). Instead of using Xs and Os and other visual aids to run your plays, however, you’ll use pictures that help you tell which products will pass a quality check, which will fail, and why. The playbook will also outline the sample sizes you’ll test and define what percentage of defective products will signal the need to reject a whole batch.
Use your written explanation of ideal form, fit, and function to identify what imperfections to test for. These will fall into 1 of 3 categories: minor defect, major defect, or critical defect. For example, a scratch on a cocktail shaker might be considered a minor defect, while a warped shaker that doesn’t fit inside the other shaker could be deemed a critical defect. The amount of defects you find in your sample size will give you an idea about whether you can ship your products, need to do additional testing, or have to – sigh – reject the batch outright.
You can then come up with your own sample sizes and rejection thresholds, but the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) also has a standardized acceptance quality limit (AQL) sampling system for inspection by attributes. The AQL chart can be used to provide information and guidance on inspection levels, rejection thresholds, and sample sizes for individual shipments.
If this seems like a lot, it doesn’t have to be. You don’t want to go it alone when creating a quality acceptance document. Incorporate your supplier into the process.
“It only makes sense that your supplier agrees to everything in the document so that both parties are on the same page in terms of what is and is not acceptable,” Gonzalez says.
By having quality standards clearly laid out and agreed upon ahead of time, you reduce the risk of having a drawn-out dispute with your supplier over an unsatisfactory batch of product.
Striking the right balance on quality assurance can also be tricky. You have to take a bit of a Goldilocks approach with it. Too strict and you run the risk of rejecting too much product, which can lead to delays and stockouts. Too lax and defective products can end up making their way to customers, paving the way for negative reviews. Knowing early on what is realistic for your supplier to achieve from a quality standpoint can save you a lot of time and money down the road.
Oh … and if you’ve never built a quality acceptance document before, no problem.
Templates to help structure your document are available online.
Gonzalez strongly advises against relying on your manufacturer to carry out product inspections on your behalf. “You want an impartial inspector,” he says. “You need to insist on it. Otherwise, you can be left with a supplier who cuts corners when it comes to quality assurance in the hopes of avoiding rejects.” But, Gonzalez adds, there are a few things to keep in mind when looking for a solid third-party inspection company to partner with.
Third-party inspection companies need to be available on short notice. Our partner promises to have an agent on site and ready to conduct an inspection, anywhere in continental Asia, within 24 hours. This kind of flexibility is invaluable, as it minimizes delays across our vast network of suppliers. But even if you only have a few suppliers, if the past 2 years have taught us anything, it’s that unexpected delays and last-minute changes are a fact of life. Knowing that your third-party inspection company has the flexibility to swiftly react to these changes is a huge value-add.
Find an inspection company with top-notch technology platforms that allow you to quickly and easily access all of your inspection reports across your suppliers in real time. That’s especially helpful if you’ve got a lot of suppliers (and thus a lot of inspection reports).
Your third-party inspection company should be aligned with the material in your quality acceptance document. After all, they’ll be the ones carrying out the inspections. In their reports, data should be presented clearly and succinctly, allowing you to make quick, informed decisions on which products are ready to ship. A good inspection report will begin with a summary of the main findings, followed by detailed information to support those assessments. When vetting third-party inspection companies, it’s not a bad idea to ask them for sample reports to get a feel for how they present data.
Schedule inspections as soon as your products come off the line – the sooner the better. Why? That gives you time to course correct if there’s a problem. You don’t want to be caught with insufficient inventory because of extended retesting time frames or full-batch rejections.
There’s no “one size fits all” approach to quality assurance. Every product is unique. Even 2 sellers who sell a similar product may have different ideas about what quality testing should look like. And that’s OK. You’re taking steps that give your products the best chance to arrive on the doorsteps of your customers – exactly how they expect them to be.

https://www.thrasio.com/for-sellers/case-studies/snuggle-pedic
------------------------
The founder of Snuggle-Pedic was a chiropractor-turned-entrepreneur who wanted to help his patients who suffered from chronic pain. After years of treating people with neck, back, and shoulder aches, he saw an opportunity. He designed pillows for optimal comfort while people slept, giving them healthier and more satisfying shut-eye. What was most impressive to us, however, was what set Snuggle-Pedic apart: a hero body pillow selling on a hot streak and standout features like Kool-Flow™ Tech, which allows air to travel through the pillow to help keep you cooler and sweat-free.
When Thrasio bought Snuggle-Pedic, we knew that staying atop the market would be a pillow fight. Why? The foam and fabric in the brand’s pillows are manufactured in the U.S. – which drives up both cost of goods sold and price points. We had to prove to customers that these pillows were worth the extra money by showcasing what makes them unique.
Customer reviews gave us insights into why people are softies for Snuggle-Pedic. The resulting brand strategy highlights the qualities customers want and love in the product line: the body fit of memory foam, the customizability of pillows shipped with an additional bag of fill material, and better breathability from covers with Kool-Flow Tech™. Even the Sandman would shell out for such luxuries.
Our creative team saw the brand’s star potential. Armed with a new SEO strategy, copywriters optimized listings and applied long-tail keywords. Team members added high-resolution photos and designers created graphics to show what sets Snuggle-Pedic pillows apart from competitors and how they support more comfortable sleep. The body pillow listing in particular saw improvements, including a 47% increase in sessions and an 18% jump in conversions within a year from acquisition.
Attracting bigger squads in the land of nod also means being everywhere potential customers are. Our PPC strategy allows us to be highly visible on Amazon. In addition to running Top Deals and Lightning Deals, we constantly strategize to be competitive in sponsored posts.
The result? Snuggle-Pedic regularly nabs top spots in search-results pages and frequently appears in Amazon’s “highly rated” products section. And the best part: we saw a 50% year-over-year increase in paid revenue from January-May 2021 to the same period in 2022, while PPC spend decreased 10% – highlighting our increasing efficiency.
Heading into the Turkey 5 – Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday – we focused on improving performance for hero listings by investing more resources into PPC, coupons, and affiliate promotions. The push positioned the hero listings on page 1 for priority keywords and drove a 369% increase in year-over-year revenue for that period. It also paved the way for a successful Thanksgiving Day Lightning Deal and better post-T5 daily profit.
Becky Cameron Home went from one successful product to a cohesive brand through expansive creative updates and pay-per-click marketing initiatives for every single product. We increased the brand's Best Sellers Rank by 95% in less than three weeks.

https://www.thrasio.com/for-sellers/case-studies/angry-orange
------------------------
Angry Orange, a pet-odor eliminator spray, was a 4-year-old brand generating more than $2 million in annual revenue when founder Adam St. George decided to exit the Amazon FBA game. Within a week of meeting the team at Thrasio, the deal was done.
This commercial-grade product was an impressive success, but the brand needed to become consumer-ready. The only logical move was a comprehensive rebrand of the entire Angry Orange product line.
To make the product consumer-ready, we completely revamped the packaging. A comprehensive rebrand of the Angry Orange product line told a story that also built consumer trust.
These improvements lent themselves to impactful listing optimizations, emphasizing the brand story and value within listing copy, imagery and video, and A+ content.
Thrasio’s marketing team built growth from both on-Amazon placements as well as off-Amazon, traffic-generating channels like Facebook and Google. With its high level of consumer interest, it was clear Angry Orange had the chops to grow into DTC channels as well, contributing 21% of total sales since March 2020. Thrasio’s marketing initiatives also included influencer marketing agreements, which have evolved to include celebrity endorsements.
The original 8oz Angry Orange concentrate was a hero product that earned a loyal cult following. Thrasio took product innovation to a new level by creating a ready-to-use version of the concentrate in multiple sizes, including a gallon jug. We expanded the product line to include a ready-to-use spray for stain removal and introduced a bathroom spray in early 2020.
Angry Orange has since experienced steady growth on Amazon. Thanks to our wholesale team, consumers also can find it on retail shelves. Select Target, Walmart, Ace Hardware, and True Value stores now sell Angry Orange to shoppers across the United States.

------------------------
When Thrasio acquired Becky Cameron Home, the company’s hero product was well-ranked in the pillow category on Amazon and boasted 12,000 reviews. We built on this position by applying creative updates and rebuilding marketing initiatives from the ground up. This increased sales and a new inventory forecast – all part of a comprehensive brand strategy.
With more than 2,500 Amazon Standard Identification Numbers (ASINs), Becky Cameron Home was our largest brand acquisition to date. Our first order of business was to consolidate the product line to help drive sales velocity. We also knew we could save dramatically on costs by shoring up the supply chain.
Every Thrasher had a hand in this brand's success — combing through each listing to update creative, SEO title tags, and ensure each listing was Amazon TOS compliant. We also added two new suppliers and increased manufacturing capacity by 5X. We then built data set tools to help us manage a brand of this size and larger.
When we acquired Becky Cameron Home, the 2-Pack Gel Queen Pillow Set had the second-highest number of reviews in the category on Amazon. We significantly increased ad spend and optimized the listing from SEO to creative branding.
Many ASINs in this brand did not have a complete listing, which negatively affected SEO. For each listing, we updated branding with a new luxe feel and added 9 listing photos and A+ content to increase trust.
A robust marketing strategy for this brand held a big opportunity to help drive growth. Pay-per-click advertising was a huge part of that approach, with other efforts including Amazon events (e.g. Amazon Live), affiliate marketing, social media, and DTC.

https://www.thrasio.com/for-sellers/case-studies/crafts-4-all
------------------------
When we purchased Crafts 4 All, the hero product was already #1 in its category on Amazon. Thrasio built on that position by improving the brand's creative, investing heavily in pay-per-click marketing, and expanding the product line. Our supply chain team also went to work to ensure the brand never ran out of inventory – no small feat given the spike in demand caused by COVID-19.
Crafts 4 All presented a classic supply-and-demand challenge, but COVID-19 was the real hurdle to overcome. We dug deep into the manufacturing process and quickly found we'd need to shore up the brand's supply chain to ensure we could continue to make products no matter what disruption came next.
We leveraged the data and learnings from early COVID-19 supply chain scarcity into our forecasting for the 2020 holiday season. No longer constrained by on-hand inventory, we were able to sell freely in Q4 — pushing promotions and PPC for a sustained increase in sales continuing into 2021.
We packaged our top products to fit into a niche subcategory, which made it easier to consistently maintain top rank.
What can we say? We like being #1.
We launched an additional variation to the hero product. Offering three different sized kits at three different price points within an established listing drove sales with minimal impact on day-to-day operations.
Our updated branding added color to the packaging (and therefore the listing photos). Not only did the products stand out in the search results, they also made the kit a more giftable item. Our paint sets were one of the top-performing products in Q4 2020.

https://www.thrasio.com/for-sellers/case-studies/this-worx
------------------------
The owner of ThisWorx founded a small brand led by one popular product – a handheld car vacuum that customers loved. Thrasio built on that success by improving the brand's search engine optimization (SEO) strategies, adding professional photos and videos, and investing in a hefty marketing push. The result? The brand became a success in only a few months.
When we first acquired ThisWorx, we were neck-and-neck with another brand offering a very similar product. Thrasio needed to identify the competitive edge to our car vacuum.
ThisWorx Deal of the Day (DOTD) turned out to be the brand's first $1 million day. Since that first deal, we've built a strategy of running as many DOTDs as possible, supplementing with lightning deals in between. To date, ThisWorx has had six $1 million days and made over $20 million on deals alone.
We increased our vacuum’s price by 17% (from $29.97 to $34.99) to make running our deal strategy possible and drive sales. It also signaled to shoppers that ThisWorx products are built with more quality and longevity than our competitors' products.
ThisWorx sold more vacuums on Prime Day in 2020 than Thrasio's whole portfolio. We experienced 405% year-over-year increase on Prime Day and now have 47X more reviews since acquisition.
Our ThisWorx branding refresh included professional photography, upgraded packaging, and strategic copy – proving ThisWorx as the higher quality choice. We've maneuvered past the competition ever since.

https://www.thrasio.com/for-sellers/case-studies/trailbuddy
------------------------
When Thrasio acquired TrailBuddy — an outdoor brand with two separate storefronts — the company already had a solid reputation for making top-quality products. Both its trekking poles and boulder net products held Best Seller Badges and had strong Best Sellers Ranks in Amazon's sports & outdoor category. We immediately saw opportunities to build on TrailBuddy's position.
TrailBuddy was already a healthy brand, so the best path forward for growth was to increase visibility to shoppers. Thrasio revamped the brand's pay-per-click marketing strategies, launched generous customer service initiatives, and brought TrailBuddy into new global markets and online channels.
After wins in the U.S., Thrasio’s international team launched TrailBuddy trekking poles in Canada and the UK. The growth was impressive. In Canada, TrailBuddy reached the #1 Best Sellers Rank in under two weeks. On the third day in the UK market, TrailBuddy trekking poles reached #2 in search results.
We safeguarded the 4.7-star rating with generous customer service initiatives that go above and beyond customer expectations. Today, our customer obsession team has an average response time of about 2 hours. We also track trending customer suggestions for product improvements and immediately share that feedback with brand management to develop even stronger products in the future.
We took every advertisement opportunity Amazon offers with this brand. In the first year we owned the business, we made a 6-figure investment in pay-per-click marketing to build volume.
Our model allows us to make early strategic investments that lead to long-term gains for our brands.
After testing the quality and durability of our competitors’ products, we were confident TrailBuddy was a high-quality brand. That allowed us to experiment with new distribution and marketing strategies without the risk of sacrificing ratings and reviews. The data and insights we gained from that test-and-learn period now inform growth strategies for other brands in our portfolio.

https://www.thrasio.com/for-sellers/case-studies/beast-gear
------------------------
When Thrasio acquired Beast Gear – a UK-based fitness-equipment company – the owner had built personal connections with many of the brand's customers. Brand loyalty was impressive, but as the company grew, that level of engagement wasn’t scalable, and the competition was closing in.
Three months post-acquisition, COVID-19 hit, and demand for home-fitness equipment surged. That was good for Beast Gear – but demand for competitors' products also spiked, the supply chain was becoming unreliable, and Brexit was looming.
When Brexit came to a head in early 2021, pressure mounted on Amazon sellers operating in the EU. To serve both UK and EU customers, they had to find separate storage facilities and divvy up their inventory. Miss the deadline, and they’d face steep customs fees.
Thrasio’s Supply Chain, Finance, and Brand Management teams went to work for Beast Gear. In the face of unprecedented demand for shipping and warehousing, our teams revamped the inventory pipeline to meet the changing market conditions. They also created new listings for Amazon Europe.
When we purchased Beast Gear, its products were available in the United Arab Emirates and Australia, but storing and shipping merchandise to those markets cost more than they delivered in profit. We cut our losses there and focused on launching in the U.S., where forecasting showed a much stronger market.
Originally, Beast Gear had several independent listings for skipping ropes. By combining the listings and merging the ratings and reviews for each variation, Beast Gear Skipping Ropes quickly earned the Best Seller Badge.
To expand the brand’s consumer base, we pivoted the Beast Gear hyper-intense bodybuilder image to one with broader appeal. Thrasio’s Creative team replaced low-quality images and stock photos on its Amazon listings with professional product photography. The new look paid off when the pandemic drove people to look for simple, unintimidating home-fitness solutions.

https://www.thrasio.com/for-sellers/case-studies/cloud-massage
------------------------
Cloud Massage had been selling successfully on Amazon for over a year when Thrasio bought the brand. The hero product's unique appeal? Users can enjoy the foot-and-calf massager while sitting up, reclining, or lying down — whatever position they find most comfortable. We built on that success with an all-out marketing strategy to grow the brand.
In order to scale Cloud Massage, we increased inventory and more than doubled manufacturing capacity. We also kicked our growth strategy into high gear utilizing a mix of coupons, Amazon Deals, celebrity endorsements, and pay-per-click advertising efforts.
We started offering coupons for Cloud Massage right away. The strategy worked. The deep discounts incentivized conversions, and the brand’s sales velocity increased enough to make the product eligible for Amazon Deals. The brand's Best Sellers Rank improved significantly, it nabbed the Best Seller Badge, and then Cloud Massage was off to the races.
New photos, videos, and branding took Cloud Massage from being a well-liked product to a premium, Thrasio-worthy brand. With a fresh new logo, updated color palette, and messaging focusing on the product’s versatility, the brand began climbing the ranks in health and household categories.
Thanks to Thrasio’s Product Strategy & Development team, Cloud Massage will debut a new massage product in 2022. The new version is more technologically advanced, with a new user interface, soft-touch buttons, an auto-stop feature, and a remote control.
Over on the direct-to-consumer (DTC) side, we invested heavily in paid search, paid social, SEO, email campaigns, and affiliate marketing. The investment paid off. Sales on the brand’s site jumped from $100K in annual revenue to over $100K in weekly revenue. In 2021, the brand's DTC sales revenue on Black Friday nearly doubled its DTC earnings on the same day in 2020.

As Thrasio expands, we are committed to growing our global consciousness even faster. Our impact on the environment and the opportunity to lift people up help guide every decision we make.
Through our Responsible Sourcing Program, we partner with amfori, the leading global business association for open and sustainable trade, to implement tools and best practices that evaluate the social performance of our supply chain. Suppliers are committed to follow the amfori code of conduct – 11 principles ranging from fair payments to environmental protection.
As part of our Supply Chain Sustainability initiative, we’ve adopted the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol standard to measure, manage, and report our GHG emissions. We've also partnered with Pathzero to estimate GHG emissions from port-to-port freight operations, following best practices as specified in the Protocol.
To strengthen the communities in which we live and work, we’ve created meaningful, fun, and high-engagement mentorship and philanthropic opportunities.
Thrasio’s fellowship in collaboration with Success Academy (SA) in Harlem offers high school students the opportunity to learn from our employees how to research, build, and scale a social enterprise from scratch. Fellows work in teams and, after a series of workshops, are awarded seed funding to launch a minimum viable product or service in their communities. As Amazon has done for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), we also hope to further democratize entrepreneurship by inspiring students early on to explore their potential as the entrepreneurs of the future.
Being a mentor at BUILD has been a very humbling and eye-opening experience. It is incredible to see the passion that goes into developing a concept into a product that the students are proud of. Working at Thrasio gives me the confidence to tell these students that there is a world that values their entrepreneurial spirits and needs their problem-solving skills.
Being able to give back to my own middle school was an incredible professional accomplishment that’s also very important to me personally. I’m thrilled to be able to impact the communities where I grew up and to potentially introduce new career possibilities for bright young minds.
We encourage Thrashers to utilize our unlimited paid time off policy and take action on issues that are most meaningful to them.
Take off with a group of positive people out to define the future.

Though the company was initially successful, environmental factors and a lack of resources kept it from growing to its maximum potential. This gave them an idea: What if they could roll up struggling ecommerce companies into one portfolio and use a single set of operators and scalable processes to take them to the next level?

, your gateway to building a better consumer goods company. Every edition, we’ll share stories, insights, and expertise on a topic critical to the industry. This issue: the importance of quality assurance and making sure the products you deliver truly deliver.
Talk about top shelf. Thrasio’s wildly popular pet odor eliminator spray Angry Orange now can be found at 1,750 Target stores, more than 1,500 PetSmart stores, more than 500 Ace/True Value Hardware stores – and continues to sell like hotcakes on Amazon, Walmart as well as the Angry Orange site. No matter where they shop, customers expect a product that’s best in show. After all, when your furry friend revenge-pees on your rug, you want nothing less than a blue-ribbon solution. That’s why we implement rigorous quality controls right where Angry Orange is made: at Toledo, Ohio-based Chempace Corporation. The result? A product that comes up smelling like roses – or rather oranges – every single time.
At Thrasio, we have quality assurance technicians, chemists, and engineers who continually improve upon products and processes. Why? So when customers try a Thrasio product, they’re delighted with the experience every single time.
Your customers expect the best. Here are 5 steps to build a strong quality assurance program and become more effective at preventing the defective.
Everyone’s been there. You buy a product that you’re excited to use, and then, when you need it, it fails to live up to its claims. Total headache. But for a business owner, one defective item can potentially set off a torrent of torment: a batch that has to be recalled, poor reviews that affect customer acquisition and loyalty, and even additional rounds of production. Fortunately, a strong quality assurance program can save the day, catching defective products before they ever ship to your customers.
If you don’t have a program in place, fear not: Axel Gonzalez has your back. Thrasio’s senior director of quality assurance and sustainability shares 5 steps to get you started.
Take, for example, the premium 10-piece bartender set Thrasio sells through our Mixology & Craft brand. It’s a showpiece with a premium price point. As such, its form can’t have scratches, dirty marks, or any flaws in its shape. Its strainer has to snugly fit inside the shaker so that no liquid leaks, while each piece must also fit in the display stand. And in order to meet Mixology & Craft’s goal of creating delicious cocktails, the shakers need to function as closed vessels that allow you to quickly mix ingredients together while simultaneously chilling the drink. This bartender set needs to bring your dreams of perfect libations to life.
Take some time to think about how form, fit, and function apply to your products. Literally make a list. This is the start of your quality assurance program, how you’ll begin to understand which attributes need to be assessed and tested. Depending on the complexity of your product, it could be a long list. But by clearly identifying what really matters to your products early on, you’ll set yourself up for a smooth operation and strong defense against trouble down the road.
Once you’ve decided what you’re going to test for, you need a resource to guide you through the process. Enter the quality acceptance document.
“The quality acceptance document is essentially the playbook that you will use to carry out your product inspections,” Gonzalez notes.
Picture a playbook for an NFL team. At its most basic, you’ll have your coaching staff and players (or, who’s leading and conducting the testing process), your schedule (how often you test), and your gameplan (how you’ll conduct tests). Instead of using Xs and Os and other visual aids to run your plays, however, you’ll use pictures that help you tell which products will pass a quality check, which will fail, and why. The playbook will also outline the sample sizes you’ll test and define what percentage of defective products will signal the need to reject a whole batch.
Use your written explanation of ideal form, fit, and function to identify what imperfections to test for. These will fall into 1 of 3 categories: minor defect, major defect, or critical defect. For example, a scratch on a cocktail shaker might be considered a minor defect, while a warped shaker that doesn’t fit inside the other shaker could be deemed a critical defect. The amount of defects you find in your sample size will give you an idea about whether you can ship your products, need to do additional testing, or have to – sigh – reject the batch outright.
You can then come up with your own sample sizes and rejection thresholds, but the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) also has a standardized acceptance quality limit (AQL) sampling system for inspection by attributes. The AQL chart can be used to provide information and guidance on inspection levels, rejection thresholds, and sample sizes for individual shipments.
If this seems like a lot, it doesn’t have to be. You don’t want to go it alone when creating a quality acceptance document. Incorporate your supplier into the process.
“It only makes sense that your supplier agrees to everything in the document so that both parties are on the same page in terms of what is and is not acceptable,” Gonzalez says.
By having quality standards clearly laid out and agreed upon ahead of time, you reduce the risk of having a drawn-out dispute with your supplier over an unsatisfactory batch of product.
Striking the right balance on quality assurance can also be tricky. You have to take a bit of a Goldilocks approach with it. Too strict and you run the risk of rejecting too much product, which can lead to delays and stockouts. Too lax and defective products can end up making their way to customers, paving the way for negative reviews. Knowing early on what is realistic for your supplier to achieve from a quality standpoint can save you a lot of time and money down the road.
Oh … and if you’ve never built a quality acceptance document before, no problem.
Templates to help structure your document are available online.
Gonzalez strongly advises against relying on your manufacturer to carry out product inspections on your behalf. “You want an impartial inspector,” he says. “You need to insist on it. Otherwise, you can be left with a supplier who cuts corners when it comes to quality assurance in the hopes of avoiding rejects.” But, Gonzalez adds, there are a few things to keep in mind when looking for a solid third-party inspection company to partner with.
Third-party inspection companies need to be available on short notice. Our partner promises to have an agent on site and ready to conduct an inspection, anywhere in continental Asia, within 24 hours. This kind of flexibility is invaluable, as it minimizes delays across our vast network of suppliers. But even if you only have a few suppliers, if the past 2 years have taught us anything, it’s that unexpected delays and last-minute changes are a fact of life. Knowing that your third-party inspection company has the flexibility to swiftly react to these changes is a huge value-add.
Find an inspection company with top-notch technology platforms that allow you to quickly and easily access all of your inspection reports across your suppliers in real time. That’s especially helpful if you’ve got a lot of suppliers (and thus a lot of inspection reports).
Your third-party inspection company should be aligned with the material in your quality acceptance document. After all, they’ll be the ones carrying out the inspections. In their reports, data should be presented clearly and succinctly, allowing you to make quick, informed decisions on which products are ready to ship. A good inspection report will begin with a summary of the main findings, followed by detailed information to support those assessments. When vetting third-party inspection companies, it’s not a bad idea to ask them for sample reports to get a feel for how they present data.
Schedule inspections as soon as your products come off the line – the sooner the better. Why? That gives you time to course correct if there’s a problem. You don’t want to be caught with insufficient inventory because of extended retesting time frames or full-batch rejections.
There’s no “one size fits all” approach to quality assurance. Every product is unique. Even 2 sellers who sell a similar product may have different ideas about what quality testing should look like. And that’s OK. You’re taking steps that give your products the best chance to arrive on the doorsteps of your customers – exactly how they expect them to be.

As Thrasio expands, we are committed to growing our global consciousness even faster. Our impact on the environment and the opportunity to lift people up help guide every decision we make.
Through our Responsible Sourcing Program, we partner with amfori, the leading global business association for open and sustainable trade, to implement tools and best practices that evaluate the social performance of our supply chain. Suppliers are committed to follow the amfori code of conduct – 11 principles ranging from fair payments to environmental protection.
As part of our Supply Chain Sustainability initiative, we’ve adopted the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol standard to measure, manage, and report our GHG emissions. We've also partnered with Pathzero to estimate GHG emissions from port-to-port freight operations, following best practices as specified in the Protocol.
To strengthen the communities in which we live and work, we’ve created meaningful, fun, and high-engagement mentorship and philanthropic opportunities.
Thrasio’s fellowship in collaboration with Success Academy (SA) in Harlem offers high school students the opportunity to learn from our employees how to research, build, and scale a social enterprise from scratch. Fellows work in teams and, after a series of workshops, are awarded seed funding to launch a minimum viable product or service in their communities. As Amazon has done for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), we also hope to further democratize entrepreneurship by inspiring students early on to explore their potential as the entrepreneurs of the future.
Being a mentor at BUILD has been a very humbling and eye-opening experience. It is incredible to see the passion that goes into developing a concept into a product that the students are proud of. Working at Thrasio gives me the confidence to tell these students that there is a world that values their entrepreneurial spirits and needs their problem-solving skills.
Being able to give back to my own middle school was an incredible professional accomplishment that’s also very important to me personally. I’m thrilled to be able to impact the communities where I grew up and to potentially introduce new career possibilities for bright young minds.
We encourage Thrashers to utilize our unlimited paid time off policy and take action on issues that are most meaningful to them.
Take off with a group of positive people out to define the future.

Some say fortune favors the brave. Josh and Carlos’ good fortune started when they met while working on a purpose-driven jewelry brand called Bravelets, founded by current Thrasio COO Stephanie Fox. Though the company was initially successful, environmental factors and a lack of resources kept it from growing to its maximum potential. This gave them an idea: What if they could roll up struggling ecommerce companies into one portfolio and use a single set of operators and scalable processes to take them to the next level? Talk about entering a brave new world. Together, they disrupted the 3P marketplace on Amazon and established a category that has gone on to inspire hundreds of competitors.

, your gateway to building a better consumer goods company. Every edition, we’ll share stories, insights, and expertise on a topic critical to the industry. This issue: the importance of quality assurance and making sure the products you deliver truly deliver.
Talk about top shelf. Thrasio’s wildly popular pet odor eliminator spray Angry Orange now can be found at 1,750 Target stores, more than 1,500 PetSmart stores, more than 500 Ace/True Value Hardware stores – and continues to sell like hotcakes on Amazon, Walmart as well as the Angry Orange site. No matter where they shop, customers expect a product that’s best in show. After all, when your furry friend revenge-pees on your rug, you want nothing less than a blue-ribbon solution. That’s why we implement rigorous quality controls right where Angry Orange is made: at Toledo, Ohio-based Chempace Corporation. The result? A product that comes up smelling like roses – or rather oranges – every single time.
At Thrasio, we have quality assurance technicians, chemists, and engineers who continually improve upon products and processes. Why? So when customers try a Thrasio product, they’re delighted with the experience every single time.
Your customers expect the best. Here are 5 steps to build a strong quality assurance program and become more effective at preventing the defective.
Everyone’s been there. You buy a product that you’re excited to use, and then, when you need it, it fails to live up to its claims. Total headache. But for a business owner, one defective item can potentially set off a torrent of torment: a batch that has to be recalled, poor reviews that affect customer acquisition and loyalty, and even additional rounds of production. Fortunately, a strong quality assurance program can save the day, catching defective products before they ever ship to your customers.
If you don’t have a program in place, fear not: Axel Gonzalez has your back. Thrasio’s senior director of quality assurance and sustainability shares 5 steps to get you started.
Take, for example, the premium 10-piece bartender set Thrasio sells through our Mixology & Craft brand. It’s a showpiece with a premium price point. As such, its form can’t have scratches, dirty marks, or any flaws in its shape. Its strainer has to snugly fit inside the shaker so that no liquid leaks, while each piece must also fit in the display stand. And in order to meet Mixology & Craft’s goal of creating delicious cocktails, the shakers need to function as closed vessels that allow you to quickly mix ingredients together while simultaneously chilling the drink. This bartender set needs to bring your dreams of perfect libations to life.
Take some time to think about how form, fit, and function apply to your products. Literally make a list. This is the start of your quality assurance program, how you’ll begin to understand which attributes need to be assessed and tested. Depending on the complexity of your product, it could be a long list. But by clearly identifying what really matters to your products early on, you’ll set yourself up for a smooth operation and strong defense against trouble down the road.
Once you’ve decided what you’re going to test for, you need a resource to guide you through the process. Enter the quality acceptance document.
“The quality acceptance document is essentially the playbook that you will use to carry out your product inspections,” Gonzalez notes.
Picture a playbook for an NFL team. At its most basic, you’ll have your coaching staff and players (or, who’s leading and conducting the testing process), your schedule (how often you test), and your gameplan (how you’ll conduct tests). Instead of using Xs and Os and other visual aids to run your plays, however, you’ll use pictures that help you tell which products will pass a quality check, which will fail, and why. The playbook will also outline the sample sizes you’ll test and define what percentage of defective products will signal the need to reject a whole batch.
Use your written explanation of ideal form, fit, and function to identify what imperfections to test for. These will fall into 1 of 3 categories: minor defect, major defect, or critical defect. For example, a scratch on a cocktail shaker might be considered a minor defect, while a warped shaker that doesn’t fit inside the other shaker could be deemed a critical defect. The amount of defects you find in your sample size will give you an idea about whether you can ship your products, need to do additional testing, or have to – sigh – reject the batch outright.
You can then come up with your own sample sizes and rejection thresholds, but the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) also has a standardized acceptance quality limit (AQL) sampling system for inspection by attributes. The AQL chart can be used to provide information and guidance on inspection levels, rejection thresholds, and sample sizes for individual shipments.
If this seems like a lot, it doesn’t have to be. You don’t want to go it alone when creating a quality acceptance document. Incorporate your supplier into the process.
“It only makes sense that your supplier agrees to everything in the document so that both parties are on the same page in terms of what is and is not acceptable,” Gonzalez says.
By having quality standards clearly laid out and agreed upon ahead of time, you reduce the risk of having a drawn-out dispute with your supplier over an unsatisfactory batch of product.
Striking the right balance on quality assurance can also be tricky. You have to take a bit of a Goldilocks approach with it. Too strict and you run the risk of rejecting too much product, which can lead to delays and stockouts. Too lax and defective products can end up making their way to customers, paving the way for negative reviews. Knowing early on what is realistic for your supplier to achieve from a quality standpoint can save you a lot of time and money down the road.
Oh … and if you’ve never built a quality acceptance document before, no problem.
Templates to help structure your document are available online.
Gonzalez strongly advises against relying on your manufacturer to carry out product inspections on your behalf. “You want an impartial inspector,” he says. “You need to insist on it. Otherwise, you can be left with a supplier who cuts corners when it comes to quality assurance in the hopes of avoiding rejects.” But, Gonzalez adds, there are a few things to keep in mind when looking for a solid third-party inspection company to partner with.

Knowing that your third-party inspection company has the flexibility to swiftly react to these changes is a huge value-add.
Find an inspection company with top-notch technology platforms that allow you to quickly and easily access all of your inspection reports across your suppliers in real time. That’s especially helpful if you’ve got a lot of suppliers (and thus a lot of inspection reports).
Your third-party inspection company should be aligned with the material in your quality acceptance document. After all, they’ll be the ones carrying out the inspections. In their reports, data should be presented clearly and succinctly, allowing you to make quick, informed decisions on which products are ready to ship. A good inspection report will begin with a summary of the main findings, followed by detailed information to support those assessments. When vetting third-party inspection companies, it’s not a bad idea to ask them for sample reports to get a feel for how they present data.
Schedule inspections as soon as your products come off the line – the sooner the better. Why? That gives you time to course correct if there’s a problem. You don’t want to be caught with insufficient inventory because of extended retesting time frames or full-batch rejections.

As Thrasio expands, we are committed to growing our global consciousness even faster. Our impact on the environment and the opportunity to lift people up help guide every decision we make.
Through our Responsible Sourcing Program, we partner with amfori, the leading global business association for open and sustainable trade, to implement tools and best practices that evaluate the social performance of our supply chain. Suppliers are committed to follow the amfori code of conduct – 11 principles ranging from fair payments to environmental protection.
As part of our Supply Chain Sustainability initiative, we’ve adopted the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol standard to measure, manage, and report our GHG emissions. We've also partnered with Pathzero to estimate GHG emissions from port-to-port freight operations, following best practices as specified in the Protocol.
To strengthen the communities in which we live and work, we’ve created meaningful, fun, and high-engagement mentorship and philanthropic opportunities.
Thrasio’s fellowship in collaboration with Success Academy (SA) in Harlem offers high school students the opportunity to learn from our employees how to research, build, and scale a social enterprise from scratch. Fellows work in teams and, after a series of workshops, are awarded seed funding to launch a minimum viable product or service in their communities. As Amazon has done for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), we also hope to further democratize entrepreneurship by inspiring students early on to explore their potential as the entrepreneurs of the future.
Being a mentor at BUILD has been a very humbling and eye-opening experience. It is incredible to see the passion that goes into developing a concept into a product that the students are proud of. Working at Thrasio gives me the confidence to tell these students that there is a world that values their entrepreneurial spirits and needs their problem-solving skills.
Being able to give back to my own middle school was an incredible professional accomplishment that’s also very important to me personally. I’m thrilled to be able to impact the communities where I grew up and to potentially introduce new career possibilities for bright young minds.
We encourage Thrashers to utilize our unlimited paid time off policy and take action on issues that are most meaningful to them.
Take off with a group of positive people out to define the future.

, your gateway to building a better consumer goods company. Every edition, we’ll share stories, insights, and expertise on a topic critical to the industry. This issue: the importance of quality assurance and making sure the products you deliver truly deliver.
Talk about top shelf. Thrasio’s wildly popular pet odor eliminator spray Angry Orange now can be found at 1,750 Target stores, more than 1,500 PetSmart stores, more than 500 Ace/True Value Hardware stores – and continues to sell like hotcakes on Amazon, Walmart as well as the Angry Orange site. No matter where they shop, customers expect a product that’s best in show. After all, when your furry friend revenge-pees on your rug, you want nothing less than a blue-ribbon solution. That’s why we implement rigorous quality controls right where Angry Orange is made: at Toledo, Ohio-based Chempace Corporation. The result? A product that comes up smelling like roses – or rather oranges – every single time.
At Thrasio, we have quality assurance technicians, chemists, and engineers who continually improve upon products and processes. Why? So when customers try a Thrasio product, they’re delighted with the experience every single time.
Your customers expect the best. Here are 5 steps to build a strong quality assurance program and become more effective at preventing the defective.
Everyone’s been there. You buy a product that you’re excited to use, and then, when you need it, it fails to live up to its claims. Total headache. But for a business owner, one defective item can potentially set off a torrent of torment: a batch that has to be recalled, poor reviews that affect customer acquisition and loyalty, and even additional rounds of production. Fortunately, a strong quality assurance program can save the day, catching defective products before they ever ship to your customers.
If you don’t have a program in place, fear not: Axel Gonzalez has your back. Thrasio’s senior director of quality assurance and sustainability shares 5 steps to get you started.
Take, for example, the premium 10-piece bartender set Thrasio sells through our Mixology & Craft brand. It’s a showpiece with a premium price point. As such, its form can’t have scratches, dirty marks, or any flaws in its shape. Its strainer has to snugly fit inside the shaker so that no liquid leaks, while each piece must also fit in the display stand. And in order to meet Mixology & Craft’s goal of creating delicious cocktails, the shakers need to function as closed vessels that allow you to quickly mix ingredients together while simultaneously chilling the drink. This bartender set needs to bring your dreams of perfect libations to life.
Take some time to think about how form, fit, and function apply to your products. Literally make a list. This is the start of your quality assurance program, how you’ll begin to understand which attributes need to be assessed and tested. Depending on the complexity of your product, it could be a long list. But by clearly identifying what really matters to your products early on, you’ll set yourself up for a smooth operation and strong defense against trouble down the road.
Once you’ve decided what you’re going to test for, you need a resource to guide you through the process. Enter the quality acceptance document.
“The quality acceptance document is essentially the playbook that you will use to carry out your product inspections,” Gonzalez notes.
Picture a playbook for an NFL team. At its most basic, you’ll have your coaching staff and players (or, who’s leading and conducting the testing process), your schedule (how often you test), and your gameplan (how you’ll conduct tests). Instead of using Xs and Os and other visual aids to run your plays, however, you’ll use pictures that help you tell which products will pass a quality check, which will fail, and why. The playbook will also outline the sample sizes you’ll test and define what percentage of defective products will signal the need to reject a whole batch.
Use your written explanation of ideal form, fit, and function to identify what imperfections to test for. These will fall into 1 of 3 categories: minor defect, major defect, or critical defect. For example, a scratch on a cocktail shaker might be considered a minor defect, while a warped shaker that doesn’t fit inside the other shaker could be deemed a critical defect. The amount of defects you find in your sample size will give you an idea about whether you can ship your products, need to do additional testing, or have to – sigh – reject the batch outright.
You can then come up with your own sample sizes and rejection thresholds, but the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) also has a standardized acceptance quality limit (AQL) sampling system for inspection by attributes. The AQL chart can be used to provide information and guidance on inspection levels, rejection thresholds, and sample sizes for individual shipments.
If this seems like a lot, it doesn’t have to be. You don’t want to go it alone when creating a quality acceptance document. Incorporate your supplier into the process.
“It only makes sense that your supplier agrees to everything in the document so that both parties are on the same page in terms of what is and is not acceptable,” Gonzalez says.
By having quality standards clearly laid out and agreed upon ahead of time, you reduce the risk of having a drawn-out dispute with your supplier over an unsatisfactory batch of product.
Striking the right balance on quality assurance can also be tricky. You have to take a bit of a Goldilocks approach with it. Too strict and you run the risk of rejecting too much product, which can lead to delays and stockouts. Too lax and defective products can end up making their way to customers, paving the way for negative reviews. Knowing early on what is realistic for your supplier to achieve from a quality standpoint can save you a lot of time and money down the road.
Oh … and if you’ve never built a quality acceptance document before, no problem.
Templates to help structure your document are available online.
Gonzalez strongly advises against relying on your manufacturer to carry out product inspections on your behalf. “You want an impartial inspector,” he says. “You need to insist on it. Otherwise, you can be left with a supplier who cuts corners when it comes to quality assurance in the hopes of avoiding rejects.” But, Gonzalez adds, there are a few things to keep in mind when looking for a solid third-party inspection company to partner with.
Third-party inspection companies need to be available on short notice. Our partner promises to have an agent on site and ready to conduct an inspection, anywhere in continental Asia, within 24 hours. This kind of flexibility is invaluable, as it minimizes delays across our vast network of suppliers. But even if you only have a few suppliers, if the past 2 years have taught us anything, it’s that unexpected delays and last-minute changes are a fact of life. Knowing that your third-party inspection company has the flexibility to swiftly react to these changes is a huge value-add.
Find an inspection company with top-notch technology platforms that allow you to quickly and easily access all of your inspection reports across your suppliers in real time. That’s especially helpful if you’ve got a lot of suppliers (and thus a lot of inspection reports).
Your third-party inspection company should be aligned with the material in your quality acceptance document. After all, they’ll be the ones carrying out the inspections. In their reports, data should be presented clearly and succinctly, allowing you to make quick, informed decisions on which products are ready to ship. A good inspection report will begin with a summary of the main findings, followed by detailed information to support those assessments. When vetting third-party inspection companies, it’s not a bad idea to ask them for sample reports to get a feel for how they present data.
Schedule inspections as soon as your products come off the line – the sooner the better. Why? That gives you time to course correct if there’s a problem. You don’t want to be caught with insufficient inventory because of extended retesting time frames or full-batch rejections.
There’s no “one size fits all” approach to quality assurance. Every product is unique. Even 2 sellers who sell a similar product may have different ideas about what quality testing should look like. And that’s OK. You’re taking steps that give your products the best chance to arrive on the doorsteps of your customers – exactly how they expect them to be.

That’s why we implement rigorous quality controls right where Angry Orange is made: at Toledo, Ohio-based Chempace Corporation. The result? A product that comes up smelling like roses – or rather oranges – every single time.
At Thrasio, we have quality assurance technicians, chemists, and engineers who continually improve upon products and processes. Why? So when customers try a Thrasio product, they’re delighted with the experience every single time.
Your customers expect the best. Here are 5 steps to build a strong quality assurance program and become more effective at preventing the defective.
Everyone’s been there. You buy a product that you’re excited to use, and then, when you need it, it fails to live up to its claims. Total headache. But for a business owner, one defective item can potentially set off a torrent of torment: a batch that has to be recalled, poor reviews that affect customer acquisition and loyalty, and even additional rounds of production. Fortunately, a strong quality assurance program can save the day, catching defective products before they ever ship to your customers.
If you don’t have a program in place, fear not: Axel Gonzalez has your back. Thrasio’s senior director of quality assurance and sustainability shares 5 steps to get you started.
Take, for example, the premium 10-piece bartender set Thrasio sells through our Mixology & Craft brand. It’s a showpiece with a premium price point. As such, its form can’t have scratches, dirty marks, or any flaws in its shape. Its strainer has to snugly fit inside the shaker so that no liquid leaks, while each piece must also fit in the display stand. And in order to meet Mixology & Craft’s goal of creating delicious cocktails, the shakers need to function as closed vessels that allow you to quickly mix ingredients together while simultaneously chilling the drink. This bartender set needs to bring your dreams of perfect libations to life.
Take some time to think about how form, fit, and function apply to your products. Literally make a list. This is the start of your quality assurance program, how you’ll begin to understand which attributes need to be assessed and tested. Depending on the complexity of your product, it could be a long list. But by clearly identifying what really matters to your products early on, you’ll set yourself up for a smooth operation and strong defense against trouble down the road.
Once you’ve decided what you’re going to test for, you need a resource to guide you through the process. Enter the quality acceptance document.
“The quality acceptance document is essentially the playbook that you will use to carry out your product inspections,” Gonzalez notes.
Picture a playbook for an NFL team. At its most basic, you’ll have your coaching staff and players (or, who’s leading and conducting the testing process), your schedule (how often you test), and your gameplan (how you’ll conduct tests). Instead of using Xs and Os and other visual aids to run your plays, however, you’ll use pictures that help you tell which products will pass a quality check, which will fail, and why. The playbook will also outline the sample sizes you’ll test and define what percentage of defective products will signal the need to reject a whole batch.
Use your written explanation of ideal form, fit, and function to identify what imperfections to test for. These will fall into 1 of 3 categories: minor defect, major defect, or critical defect. For example, a scratch on a cocktail shaker might be considered a minor defect, while a warped shaker that doesn’t fit inside the other shaker could be deemed a critical defect. The amount of defects you find in your sample size will give you an idea about whether you can ship your products, need to do additional testing, or have to – sigh – reject the batch outright.
You can then come up with your own sample sizes and rejection thresholds, but the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) also has a standardized acceptance quality limit (AQL) sampling system for inspection by attributes. The AQL chart can be used to provide information and guidance on inspection levels, rejection thresholds, and sample sizes for individual shipments.
If this seems like a lot, it doesn’t have to be. You don’t want to go it alone when creating a quality acceptance document. Incorporate your supplier into the process.
“It only makes sense that your supplier agrees to everything in the document so that both parties are on the same page in terms of what is and is not acceptable,” Gonzalez says.
By having quality standards clearly laid out and agreed upon ahead of time, you reduce the risk of having a drawn-out dispute with your supplier over an unsatisfactory batch of product.
Striking the right balance on quality assurance can also be tricky. You have to take a bit of a Goldilocks approach with it. Too strict and you run the risk of rejecting too much product, which can lead to delays and stockouts. Too lax and defective products can end up making their way to customers, paving the way for negative reviews. Knowing early on what is realistic for your supplier to achieve from a quality standpoint can save you a lot of time and money down the road.
Oh … and if you’ve never built a quality acceptance document before, no problem.
Templates to help structure your document are available online.
Gonzalez strongly advises against relying on your manufacturer to carry out product inspections on your behalf. “You want an impartial inspector,” he says. “You need to insist on it. Otherwise, you can be left with a supplier who cuts corners when it comes to quality assurance in the hopes of avoiding rejects.” But, Gonzalez adds, there are a few things to keep in mind when looking for a solid third-party inspection company to partner with.
Third-party inspection companies need to be available on short notice. Our partner promises to have an agent on site and ready to conduct an inspection, anywhere in continental Asia, within 24 hours. This kind of flexibility is invaluable, as it minimizes delays across our vast network of suppliers. But even if you only have a few suppliers, if the past 2 years have taught us anything, it’s that unexpected delays and last-minute changes are a fact of life. Knowing that your third-party inspection company has the flexibility to swiftly react to these changes is a huge value-add.
Find an inspection company with top-notch technology platforms that allow you to quickly and easily access all of your inspection reports across your suppliers in real time. That’s especially helpful if you’ve got a lot of suppliers (and thus a lot of inspection reports).
Your third-party inspection company should be aligned with the material in your quality acceptance document. After all, they’ll be the ones carrying out the inspections. In their reports, data should be presented clearly and succinctly, allowing you to make quick, informed decisions on which products are ready to ship. A good inspection report will begin with a summary of the main findings, followed by detailed information to support those assessments. When vetting third-party inspection companies, it’s not a bad idea to ask them for sample reports to get a feel for how they present data.
Schedule inspections as soon as your products come off the line – the sooner the better. Why? That gives you time to course correct if there’s a problem. You don’t want to be caught with insufficient inventory because of extended retesting time frames or full-batch rejections.
There’s no “one size fits all” approach to quality assurance. Every product is unique. Even 2 sellers who sell a similar product may have different ideas about what quality testing should look like. And that’s OK. You’re taking steps that give your products the best chance to arrive on the doorsteps of your customers – exactly how they expect them to be.

As Thrasio expands, we are committed to growing our global consciousness even faster. Our impact on the environment and the opportunity to lift people up help guide every decision we make.
Through our Responsible Sourcing Program, we partner with amfori, the leading global business association for open and sustainable trade, to implement tools and best practices that evaluate the social performance of our supply chain. Suppliers are committed to follow the amfori code of conduct – 11 principles ranging from fair payments to environmental protection.
As part of our Supply Chain Sustainability initiative, we’ve adopted the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol standard to measure, manage, and report our GHG emissions. We've also partnered with Pathzero to estimate GHG emissions from port-to-port freight operations, following best practices as specified in the Protocol.
To strengthen the communities in which we live and work, we’ve created meaningful, fun, and high-engagement mentorship and philanthropic opportunities.
Thrasio’s fellowship in collaboration with Success Academy (SA) in Harlem offers high school students the opportunity to learn from our employees how to research, build, and scale a social enterprise from scratch. Fellows work in teams and, after a series of workshops, are awarded seed funding to launch a minimum viable product or service in their communities. As Amazon has done for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), we also hope to further democratize entrepreneurship by inspiring students early on to explore their potential as the entrepreneurs of the future.
Being a mentor at BUILD has been a very humbling and eye-opening experience. It is incredible to see the passion that goes into developing a concept into a product that the students are proud of. Working at Thrasio gives me the confidence to tell these students that there is a world that values their entrepreneurial spirits and needs their problem-solving skills.
Being able to give back to my own middle school was an incredible professional accomplishment that’s also very important to me personally. I’m thrilled to be able to impact the communities where I grew up and to potentially introduce new career possibilities for bright young minds.
We encourage Thrashers to utilize our unlimited paid time off policy and take action on issues that are most meaningful to them.
Take off with a group of positive people out to define the future.

Our expert leadership team includes Amazon veterans, ecommerce mavens, and successful entrepreneurs at the forefront of rethinking how goods are brought to the world.
Some say fortune favors the brave. Josh and Carlos’ good fortune started when they met while working on a purpose-driven jewelry brand called Bravelets, founded by current Thrasio COO Stephanie Fox. Though the company was initially successful, environmental factors and a lack of resources kept it from growing to its maximum potential. This gave them an idea: What if they could roll up struggling ecommerce companies into one portfolio and use a single set of operators and scalable processes to take them to the next level? Talk about entering a brave new world. Together, they disrupted the 3P marketplace on Amazon and established a category that has gone on to inspire hundreds of competitors.

, your gateway to building a better consumer goods company. Every edition, we’ll share stories, insights, and expertise on a topic critical to the industry. This issue: the importance of quality assurance and making sure the products you deliver truly deliver.
Talk about top shelf. Thrasio’s wildly popular pet odor eliminator spray Angry Orange now can be found at 1,750 Target stores, more than 1,500 PetSmart stores, more than 500 Ace/True Value Hardware stores – and continues to sell like hotcakes on Amazon, Walmart as well as the Angry Orange site. No matter where they shop, customers expect a product that’s best in show. After all, when your furry friend revenge-pees on your rug, you want nothing less than a blue-ribbon solution. That’s why we implement rigorous quality controls right where Angry Orange is made: at Toledo, Ohio-based Chempace Corporation. The result? A product that comes up smelling like roses – or rather oranges – every single time.
At Thrasio, we have quality assurance technicians, chemists, and engineers who continually improve upon products and processes. Why? So when customers try a Thrasio product, they’re delighted with the experience every single time.
Your customers expect the best. Here are 5 steps to build a strong quality assurance program and become more effective at preventing the defective.
Everyone’s been there. You buy a product that you’re excited to use, and then, when you need it, it fails to live up to its claims. Total headache. But for a business owner, one defective item can potentially set off a torrent of torment: a batch that has to be recalled, poor reviews that affect customer acquisition and loyalty, and even additional rounds of production. Fortunately, a strong quality assurance program can save the day, catching defective products before they ever ship to your customers.
If you don’t have a program in place, fear not: Axel Gonzalez has your back. Thrasio’s senior director of quality assurance and sustainability shares 5 steps to get you started.
Take, for example, the premium 10-piece bartender set Thrasio sells through our Mixology & Craft brand. It’s a showpiece with a premium price point. As such, its form can’t have scratches, dirty marks, or any flaws in its shape. Its strainer has to snugly fit inside the shaker so that no liquid leaks, while each piece must also fit in the display stand. And in order to meet Mixology & Craft’s goal of creating delicious cocktails, the shakers need to function as closed vessels that allow you to quickly mix ingredients together while simultaneously chilling the drink. This bartender set needs to bring your dreams of perfect libations to life.
Take some time to think about how form, fit, and function apply to your products. Literally make a list. This is the start of your quality assurance program, how you’ll begin to understand which attributes need to be assessed and tested. Depending on the complexity of your product, it could be a long list. But by clearly identifying what really matters to your products early on, you’ll set yourself up for a smooth operation and strong defense against trouble down the road.
Once you’ve decided what you’re going to test for, you need a resource to guide you through the process. Enter the quality acceptance document.
“The quality acceptance document is essentially the playbook that you will use to carry out your product inspections,” Gonzalez notes.
Picture a playbook for an NFL team. At its most basic, you’ll have your coaching staff and players (or, who’s leading and conducting the testing process), your schedule (how often you test), and your gameplan (how you’ll conduct tests). Instead of using Xs and Os and other visual aids to run your plays, however, you’ll use pictures that help you tell which products will pass a quality check, which will fail, and why. The playbook will also outline the sample sizes you’ll test and define what percentage of defective products will signal the need to reject a whole batch.
Use your written explanation of ideal form, fit, and function to identify what imperfections to test for. These will fall into 1 of 3 categories: minor defect, major defect, or critical defect. For example, a scratch on a cocktail shaker might be considered a minor defect, while a warped shaker that doesn’t fit inside the other shaker could be deemed a critical defect. The amount of defects you find in your sample size will give you an idea about whether you can ship your products, need to do additional testing, or have to – sigh – reject the batch outright.
You can then come up with your own sample sizes and rejection thresholds, but the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) also has a standardized acceptance quality limit (AQL) sampling system for inspection by attributes. The AQL chart can be used to provide information and guidance on inspection levels, rejection thresholds, and sample sizes for individual shipments.
If this seems like a lot, it doesn’t have to be. You don’t want to go it alone when creating a quality acceptance document. Incorporate your supplier into the process.
“It only makes sense that your supplier agrees to everything in the document so that both parties are on the same page in terms of what is and is not acceptable,” Gonzalez says.
By having quality standards clearly laid out and agreed upon ahead of time, you reduce the risk of having a drawn-out dispute with your supplier over an unsatisfactory batch of product.
Striking the right balance on quality assurance can also be tricky. You have to take a bit of a Goldilocks approach with it. Too strict and you run the risk of rejecting too much product, which can lead to delays and stockouts. Too lax and defective products can end up making their way to customers, paving the way for negative reviews. Knowing early on what is realistic for your supplier to achieve from a quality standpoint can save you a lot of time and money down the road.
Oh … and if you’ve never built a quality acceptance document before, no problem.
Templates to help structure your document are available online.
Gonzalez strongly advises against relying on your manufacturer to carry out product inspections on your behalf. “You want an impartial inspector,” he says. “You need to insist on it. Otherwise, you can be left with a supplier who cuts corners when it comes to quality assurance in the hopes of avoiding rejects.” But, Gonzalez adds, there are a few things to keep in mind when looking for a solid third-party inspection company to partner with.
Third-party inspection companies need to be available on short notice. Our partner promises to have an agent on site and ready to conduct an inspection, anywhere in continental Asia, within 24 hours. This kind of flexibility is invaluable, as it minimizes delays across our vast network of suppliers. But even if you only have a few suppliers, if the past 2 years have taught us anything, it’s that unexpected delays and last-minute changes are a fact of life. Knowing that your third-party inspection company has the flexibility to swiftly react to these changes is a huge value-add.
Find an inspection company with top-notch technology platforms that allow you to quickly and easily access all of your inspection reports across your suppliers in real time. That’s especially helpful if you’ve got a lot of suppliers (and thus a lot of inspection reports).
Your third-party inspection company should be aligned with the material in your quality acceptance document. After all, they’ll be the ones carrying out the inspections. In their reports, data should be presented clearly and succinctly, allowing you to make quick, informed decisions on which products are ready to ship. A good inspection report will begin with a summary of the main findings, followed by detailed information to support those assessments. When vetting third-party inspection companies, it’s not a bad idea to ask them for sample reports to get a feel for how they present data.
Schedule inspections as soon as your products come off the line – the sooner the better. Why? That gives you time to course correct if there’s a problem. You don’t want to be caught with insufficient inventory because of extended retesting time frames or full-batch rejections.
There’s no “one size fits all” approach to quality assurance. Every product is unique. Even 2 sellers who sell a similar product may have different ideas about what quality testing should look like. And that’s OK. You’re taking steps that give your products the best chance to arrive on the doorsteps of your customers – exactly how they expect them to be.

Während Thrasio expandiert, arbeiten wir hart daran, dass unser globales Bewusstsein noch schneller wächst. Unser Einfluss auf die Umwelt und die Gemeinden hilft uns bei der Entscheidungsfindung.
Im Rahmen unseres Programms für verantwortungsbewusste Beschaffung arbeiten wir mit dem weltweit führenden Wirtschaftsverband für offenen und nachhaltigen Handel amfori zusammen, um Instrumente und bewährte Verfahren zur Bewertung der sozialen Leistung unserer Lieferkette einzuführen. Die Lieferanten verpflichten sich, den amfori-Verhaltenskodex zu folgen, der 11 Grundsätze umfasst: von fairer Bezahlung bis zum Umweltschutz.
Im Rahmen unserer Initiative zur Nachhaltigkeit in der Lieferkette haben wir den Standard des Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol übernommen, um unsere Treibhausgasemissionen zu messen, zu verwalten und zu melden. Darüber hinaus haben wir uns mit Pathzero zusammengetan, um die GHG-Emissionen von Port-to-Port-Frachtgeschäften anhand der im Protokoll festgelegten Best Practices einzuschätzen.
Um die Gemeinschaften, in denen wir leben und arbeiten, zu stärken, haben wir bedeutsame, unterhaltsame und wirkungsvolle Mentoring- und philanthropische Möglichkeiten geschaffen.
Das Stipendium von Thrasio in Zusammenarbeit mit der Success Academy (SA) in Harlem bietet High-School-Schülern die Möglichkeit, von unseren Mitarbeitern zu lernen, wie man ein soziales Unternehmen von Grund auf recherchiert, aufbaut und erweitert. Stipendiaten arbeiten in Teams und werden nach mehreren Workshops mit Seed-Finanzierung belohnt, um in ihren Communitys mindestens ein akzeptables Produkt oder eine tragbare Dienstleistung zu starten. So wie Amazon es für kleine und mittlere Unternehmen (KMU) getan hat, hoffen wir auch, das Unternehmertum weiter zu demokratisieren, indem wir Studenten frühzeitig dazu inspirieren, ihr Potenzial als Unternehmer der Zukunft zu erkunden.
Mentorin bei BUILD zu sein, war eine sehr beeindruckende und aufschlussreiche Erfahrung. Es ist unglaublich zu sehen, mit welcher Leidenschaft ein Konzept in ein Produkt umgesetzt wird, auf das die Schüler stolz sind. Die Arbeit bei Thrasio gibt mir das Selbstvertrauen, diesen Studenten zu sagen, dass es eine Welt gibt, die ihren Unternehmergeist schätzt und ihre Lösungsfähigkeiten braucht.
Die Möglichkeit, meiner eigenen Mittelschule etwas zurückzugeben, war eine unglaubliche berufliche Leistung, die auch für mich persönlich sehr wichtig ist. Ich bin begeistert, dass ich in den Gemeinden, in denen ich aufgewachsen bin, etwas bewirken kann, und dass ich klugen jungen Köpfen neue Karrieremöglichkeiten eröffnen kann.
Wir ermutigen die Thrasher, unsere Politik der unbegrenzten bezahlten Freistellung zu nutzen und sich für die Themen einzusetzen, die ihnen am wichtigsten sind.
Machen Sie sich mit einer Gruppe positiver Menschen auf, die Zukunft zu gestalten.

As Thrasio expands across the world, we are committed to growing our global consciousness even faster. Our impact on the environment and the opportunity to lift people up help guide every decision we make.
Through our Responsible Sourcing Program, we partner with amfori, the leading global business association for open and sustainable trade, to implement tools and best practices that evaluate the social performance of our supply chain. Suppliers are committed to follow the amfori code of conduct – 11 principles ranging from fair payments to environmental protection.
As part of our Supply Chain Sustainability initiative, we’ve adopted the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol standard to measure, manage, and report our GHG emissions. We've also partnered with Pathzero to estimate GHG emissions from port-to-port freight operations, following best practices as specified in the Protocol.
To strengthen the communities in which we live and work, we’ve created meaningful, fun, and high-engagement mentorship and philanthropic opportunities.
Thrasio’s fellowship in collaboration with Success Academy (SA) in Harlem offers high school students the opportunity to learn from our employees how to research, build, and scale a social enterprise from scratch. Fellows work in teams and, after a series of workshops, are awarded seed funding to launch a minimum viable product or service in their communities. As Amazon has done for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), we also hope to further democratize entrepreneurship by inspiring students early on to explore their potential as the entrepreneurs of the future.
Being a mentor at BUILD has been a very humbling and eye-opening experience. It is incredible to see the passion that goes into developing a concept into a product that the students are proud of. Working at Thrasio gives me the confidence to tell these students that there is a world that values their entrepreneurial spirits and needs their problem-solving skills.
Being able to give back to my own middle school was an incredible professional accomplishment that’s also very important to me personally. I’m thrilled to be able to impact the communities where I grew up and to potentially introduce new career possibilities for bright young minds.
We encourage Thrashers to utilize our unlimited paid time off policy and take action on issues that are most meaningful to them.
Take off with a group of positive people out to define the future.

, your gateway to building a better consumer goods company. Every edition, we’ll share stories, insights, and expertise on a topic critical to the industry. This issue: the importance of quality assurance and making sure the products you deliver truly deliver.
Talk about top shelf. Thrasio’s wildly popular pet odor eliminator spray Angry Orange now can be found at 1,750 Target stores, more than 1,500 PetSmart stores, more than 500 Ace/True Value Hardware stores – and continues to sell like hotcakes on Amazon, Walmart as well as the Angry Orange site. No matter where they shop, customers expect a product that’s best in show. After all, when your furry friend revenge-pees on your rug, you want nothing less than a blue-ribbon solution. That’s why we implement rigorous quality controls right where Angry Orange is made: at Toledo, Ohio-based Chempace Corporation. The result? A product that comes up smelling like roses – or rather oranges – every single time.
At Thrasio, we have quality assurance technicians, chemists, and engineers who continually improve upon products and processes. Why? So when customers try a Thrasio product, they’re delighted with the experience every single time.
Your customers expect the best. Here are 5 steps to build a strong quality assurance program and become more effective at preventing the defective.
Everyone’s been there. You buy a product that you’re excited to use, and then, when you need it, it fails to live up to its claims. Total headache. But for a business owner, one defective item can potentially set off a torrent of torment: a batch that has to be recalled, poor reviews that affect customer acquisition and loyalty, and even additional rounds of production. Fortunately, a strong quality assurance program can save the day, catching defective products before they ever ship to your customers.
If you don’t have a program in place, fear not: Axel Gonzalez has your back. Thrasio’s senior director of quality assurance and sustainability shares 5 steps to get you started.
Take, for example, the premium 10-piece bartender set Thrasio sells through our Mixology & Craft brand. It’s a showpiece with a premium price point. As such, its form can’t have scratches, dirty marks, or any flaws in its shape. Its strainer has to snugly fit inside the shaker so that no liquid leaks, while each piece must also fit in the display stand. And in order to meet Mixology & Craft’s goal of creating delicious cocktails, the shakers need to function as closed vessels that allow you to quickly mix ingredients together while simultaneously chilling the drink. This bartender set needs to bring your dreams of perfect libations to life.
Take some time to think about how form, fit, and function apply to your products. Literally make a list. This is the start of your quality assurance program, how you’ll begin to understand which attributes need to be assessed and tested. Depending on the complexity of your product, it could be a long list. But by clearly identifying what really matters to your products early on, you’ll set yourself up for a smooth operation and strong defense against trouble down the road.
Once you’ve decided what you’re going to test for, you need a resource to guide you through the process. Enter the quality acceptance document.
“The quality acceptance document is essentially the playbook that you will use to carry out your product inspections,” Gonzalez notes.
Picture a playbook for an NFL team. At its most basic, you’ll have your coaching staff and players (or, who’s leading and conducting the testing process), your schedule (how often you test), and your gameplan (how you’ll conduct tests). Instead of using Xs and Os and other visual aids to run your plays, however, you’ll use pictures that help you tell which products will pass a quality check, which will fail, and why. The playbook will also outline the sample sizes you’ll test and define what percentage of defective products will signal the need to reject a whole batch.
Use your written explanation of ideal form, fit, and function to identify what imperfections to test for. These will fall into 1 of 3 categories: minor defect, major defect, or critical defect. For example, a scratch on a cocktail shaker might be considered a minor defect, while a warped shaker that doesn’t fit inside the other shaker could be deemed a critical defect. The amount of defects you find in your sample size will give you an idea about whether you can ship your products, need to do additional testing, or have to – sigh – reject the batch outright.
You can then come up with your own sample sizes and rejection thresholds, but the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) also has a standardized acceptance quality limit (AQL) sampling system for inspection by attributes. The AQL chart can be used to provide information and guidance on inspection levels, rejection thresholds, and sample sizes for individual shipments.
If this seems like a lot, it doesn’t have to be. You don’t want to go it alone when creating a quality acceptance document. Incorporate your supplier into the process.
“It only makes sense that your supplier agrees to everything in the document so that both parties are on the same page in terms of what is and is not acceptable,” Gonzalez says.
By having quality standards clearly laid out and agreed upon ahead of time, you reduce the risk of having a drawn-out dispute with your supplier over an unsatisfactory batch of product.
Striking the right balance on quality assurance can also be tricky. You have to take a bit of a Goldilocks approach with it. Too strict and you run the risk of rejecting too much product, which can lead to delays and stockouts. Too lax and defective products can end up making their way to customers, paving the way for negative reviews. Knowing early on what is realistic for your supplier to achieve from a quality standpoint can save you a lot of time and money down the road.
Oh … and if you’ve never built a quality acceptance document before, no problem.
Templates to help structure your document are available online.
Gonzalez strongly advises against relying on your manufacturer to carry out product inspections on your behalf. “You want an impartial inspector,” he says. “You need to insist on it. Otherwise, you can be left with a supplier who cuts corners when it comes to quality assurance in the hopes of avoiding rejects.” But, Gonzalez adds, there are a few things to keep in mind when looking for a solid third-party inspection company to partner with.
Third-party inspection companies need to be available on short notice. Our partner promises to have an agent on site and ready to conduct an inspection, anywhere in continental Asia, within 24 hours. This kind of flexibility is invaluable, as it minimizes delays across our vast network of suppliers. But even if you only have a few suppliers, if the past 2 years have taught us anything, it’s that unexpected delays and last-minute changes are a fact of life. Knowing that your third-party inspection company has the flexibility to swiftly react to these changes is a huge value-add.
Find an inspection company with top-notch technology platforms that allow you to quickly and easily access all of your inspection reports across your suppliers in real time. That’s especially helpful if you’ve got a lot of suppliers (and thus a lot of inspection reports).
Your third-party inspection company should be aligned with the material in your quality acceptance document. After all, they’ll be the ones carrying out the inspections. In their reports, data should be presented clearly and succinctly, allowing you to make quick, informed decisions on which products are ready to ship. A good inspection report will begin with a summary of the main findings, followed by detailed information to support those assessments. When vetting third-party inspection companies, it’s not a bad idea to ask them for sample reports to get a feel for how they present data.
Schedule inspections as soon as your products come off the line – the sooner the better. Why? That gives you time to course correct if there’s a problem. You don’t want to be caught with insufficient inventory because of extended retesting time frames or full-batch rejections.
There’s no “one size fits all” approach to quality assurance. Every product is unique. Even 2 sellers who sell a similar product may have different ideas about what quality testing should look like. And that’s OK. You’re taking steps that give your products the best chance to arrive on the doorsteps of your customers – exactly how they expect them to be.

Wer wagt, gewinnt. Josh Silberstein und Carlos Cashman verkörpern dieses Motto. Die beiden Thrasio Gründer trafen sich bei der Arbeit an einer Kampagne für die Schmuckmarke Bravelets von Stephanie Fox, die heute COO bei Thrasio ist. Trotz anfänglichen Erfolgen konnte die Marke aufgrund von externen Faktoren und mangelnden Ressourcen jedoch nie ihr volles Potenzial entfalten. Das brachte das Team auf eine Idee: Könnte man angeschlagene E-Commerce-Shops aufkaufen und diese mit Hilfe von skalierbaren Prozessen in die nächste Liga befördern? Gemeinsam wagten sie sich auf ein völlig neues Terrain vor. Dabei haben sie nicht nur den Amazon-Markt für Dritt-Anbieter aufgemischt, sondern eine komplett neue Branche geschaffen, deren Erfolg hunderte von Wettbewerbern hervorgebracht hat.

Some say fortune favors the brave. Josh and Carlos’ good fortune started when they met while working on a purpose-driven jewelry brand called Bravelets, founded by current Thrasio COO Stephanie Fox. Though the company was initially successful, environmental factors and a lack of resources kept it from growing to its maximum potential. This gave them an idea: What if they could roll up struggling ecommerce companies into one portfolio and use a single set of operators and scalable processes to take them to the next level? Talk about entering a brave new world. Together, they disrupted the 3P marketplace on Amazon and established a category that has gone on to inspire hundreds of competitors.

, your gateway to building a better consumer goods company. Every edition, we’ll share stories, insights, and expertise on a topic critical to the industry. This issue: the importance of quality assurance and making sure the products you deliver truly deliver.
Talk about top shelf. Thrasio’s wildly popular pet odor eliminator spray Angry Orange now can be found at 1,750 Target stores, more than 1,500 PetSmart stores, more than 500 Ace/True Value Hardware stores – and continues to sell like hotcakes on Amazon, Walmart as well as the Angry Orange site. No matter where they shop, customers expect a product that’s best in show. After all, when your furry friend revenge-pees on your rug, you want nothing less than a blue-ribbon solution. That’s why we implement rigorous quality controls right where Angry Orange is made: at Toledo, Ohio-based Chempace Corporation. The result? A product that comes up smelling like roses – or rather oranges – every single time.
At Thrasio, we have quality assurance technicians, chemists, and engineers who continually improve upon products and processes. Why? So when customers try a Thrasio product, they’re delighted with the experience every single time.
Your customers expect the best. Here are 5 steps to build a strong quality assurance program and become more effective at preventing the defective.
Everyone’s been there. You buy a product that you’re excited to use, and then, when you need it, it fails to live up to its claims. Total headache. But for a business owner, one defective item can potentially set off a torrent of torment: a batch that has to be recalled, poor reviews that affect customer acquisition and loyalty, and even additional rounds of production. Fortunately, a strong quality assurance program can save the day, catching defective products before they ever ship to your customers.
If you don’t have a program in place, fear not: Axel Gonzalez has your back. Thrasio’s senior director of quality assurance and sustainability shares 5 steps to get you started.
Take, for example, the premium 10-piece bartender set Thrasio sells through our Mixology & Craft brand. It’s a showpiece with a premium price point. As such, its form can’t have scratches, dirty marks, or any flaws in its shape. Its strainer has to snugly fit inside the shaker so that no liquid leaks, while each piece must also fit in the display stand. And in order to meet Mixology & Craft’s goal of creating delicious cocktails, the shakers need to function as closed vessels that allow you to quickly mix ingredients together while simultaneously chilling the drink. This bartender set needs to bring your dreams of perfect libations to life.
Take some time to think about how form, fit, and function apply to your products. Literally make a list. This is the start of your quality assurance program, how you’ll begin to understand which attributes need to be assessed and tested. Depending on the complexity of your product, it could be a long list. But by clearly identifying what really matters to your products early on, you’ll set yourself up for a smooth operation and strong defense against trouble down the road.
Once you’ve decided what you’re going to test for, you need a resource to guide you through the process. Enter the quality acceptance document.
“The quality acceptance document is essentially the playbook that you will use to carry out your product inspections,” Gonzalez notes.
Picture a playbook for an NFL team. At its most basic, you’ll have your coaching staff and players (or, who’s leading and conducting the testing process), your schedule (how often you test), and your gameplan (how you’ll conduct tests). Instead of using Xs and Os and other visual aids to run your plays, however, you’ll use pictures that help you tell which products will pass a quality check, which will fail, and why. The playbook will also outline the sample sizes you’ll test and define what percentage of defective products will signal the need to reject a whole batch.
Use your written explanation of ideal form, fit, and function to identify what imperfections to test for. These will fall into 1 of 3 categories: minor defect, major defect, or critical defect. For example, a scratch on a cocktail shaker might be considered a minor defect, while a warped shaker that doesn’t fit inside the other shaker could be deemed a critical defect. The amount of defects you find in your sample size will give you an idea about whether you can ship your products, need to do additional testing, or have to – sigh – reject the batch outright.
You can then come up with your own sample sizes and rejection thresholds, but the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) also has a standardized acceptance quality limit (AQL) sampling system for inspection by attributes. The AQL chart can be used to provide information and guidance on inspection levels, rejection thresholds, and sample sizes for individual shipments.
If this seems like a lot, it doesn’t have to be. You don’t want to go it alone when creating a quality acceptance document. Incorporate your supplier into the process.
“It only makes sense that your supplier agrees to everything in the document so that both parties are on the same page in terms of what is and is not acceptable,” Gonzalez says.
By having quality standards clearly laid out and agreed upon ahead of time, you reduce the risk of having a drawn-out dispute with your supplier over an unsatisfactory batch of product.
Striking the right balance on quality assurance can also be tricky. You have to take a bit of a Goldilocks approach with it. Too strict and you run the risk of rejecting too much product, which can lead to delays and stockouts. Too lax and defective products can end up making their way to customers, paving the way for negative reviews. Knowing early on what is realistic for your supplier to achieve from a quality standpoint can save you a lot of time and money down the road.
Oh … and if you’ve never built a quality acceptance document before, no problem.
Templates to help structure your document are available online.
Gonzalez strongly advises against relying on your manufacturer to carry out product inspections on your behalf. “You want an impartial inspector,” he says. “You need to insist on it. Otherwise, you can be left with a supplier who cuts corners when it comes to quality assurance in the hopes of avoiding rejects.” But, Gonzalez adds, there are a few things to keep in mind when looking for a solid third-party inspection company to partner with.
Third-party inspection companies need to be available on short notice. Our partner promises to have an agent on site and ready to conduct an inspection, anywhere in continental Asia, within 24 hours. This kind of flexibility is invaluable, as it minimizes delays across our vast network of suppliers. But even if you only have a few suppliers, if the past 2 years have taught us anything, it’s that unexpected delays and last-minute changes are a fact of life. Knowing that your third-party inspection company has the flexibility to swiftly react to these changes is a huge value-add.
Find an inspection company with top-notch technology platforms that allow you to quickly and easily access all of your inspection reports across your suppliers in real time. That’s especially helpful if you’ve got a lot of suppliers (and thus a lot of inspection reports).
Your third-party inspection company should be aligned with the material in your quality acceptance document. After all, they’ll be the ones carrying out the inspections. In their reports, data should be presented clearly and succinctly, allowing you to make quick, informed decisions on which products are ready to ship. A good inspection report will begin with a summary of the main findings, followed by detailed information to support those assessments. When vetting third-party inspection companies, it’s not a bad idea to ask them for sample reports to get a feel for how they present data.
Schedule inspections as soon as your products come off the line – the sooner the better. Why? That gives you time to course correct if there’s a problem. You don’t want to be caught with insufficient inventory because of extended retesting time frames or full-batch rejections.
There’s no “one size fits all” approach to quality assurance. Every product is unique. Even 2 sellers who sell a similar product may have different ideas about what quality testing should look like. And that’s OK. You’re taking steps that give your products the best chance to arrive on the doorsteps of your customers – exactly how they expect them to be.

, your gateway to building a better consumer goods company. Every edition, we’ll share stories, insights, and expertise on a topic critical to the industry. This issue: the importance of quality assurance and making sure the products you deliver truly deliver.
Talk about top shelf. Thrasio’s wildly popular pet odor eliminator spray Angry Orange now can be found at 1,750 Target stores, more than 1,500 PetSmart stores, more than 500 Ace/True Value Hardware stores – and continues to sell like hotcakes on Amazon, Walmart as well as the Angry Orange site. No matter where they shop, customers expect a product that’s best in show. After all, when your furry friend revenge-pees on your rug, you want nothing less than a blue-ribbon solution. That’s why we implement rigorous quality controls right where Angry Orange is made: at Toledo, Ohio-based Chempace Corporation. The result? A product that comes up smelling like roses – or rather oranges – every single time.
At Thrasio, we have quality assurance technicians, chemists, and engineers who continually improve upon products and processes. Why? So when customers try a Thrasio product, they’re delighted with the experience every single time.
Your customers expect the best. Here are 5 steps to build a strong quality assurance program and become more effective at preventing the defective.
Everyone’s been there. You buy a product that you’re excited to use, and then, when you need it, it fails to live up to its claims. Total headache. But for a business owner, one defective item can potentially set off a torrent of torment: a batch that has to be recalled, poor reviews that affect customer acquisition and loyalty, and even additional rounds of production. Fortunately, a strong quality assurance program can save the day, catching defective products before they ever ship to your customers.
If you don’t have a program in place, fear not: Axel Gonzalez has your back. Thrasio’s senior director of quality assurance and sustainability shares 5 steps to get you started.
Take, for example, the premium 10-piece bartender set Thrasio sells through our Mixology & Craft brand. It’s a showpiece with a premium price point. As such, its form can’t have scratches, dirty marks, or any flaws in its shape. Its strainer has to snugly fit inside the shaker so that no liquid leaks, while each piece must also fit in the display stand. And in order to meet Mixology & Craft’s goal of creating delicious cocktails, the shakers need to function as closed vessels that allow you to quickly mix ingredients together while simultaneously chilling the drink. This bartender set needs to bring your dreams of perfect libations to life.
Take some time to think about how form, fit, and function apply to your products. Literally make a list. This is the start of your quality assurance program, how you’ll begin to understand which attributes need to be assessed and tested. Depending on the complexity of your product, it could be a long list. But by clearly identifying what really matters to your products early on, you’ll set yourself up for a smooth operation and strong defense against trouble down the road.
Once you’ve decided what you’re going to test for, you need a resource to guide you through the process. Enter the quality acceptance document.
“The quality acceptance document is essentially the playbook that you will use to carry out your product inspections,” Gonzalez notes.
Picture a playbook for an NFL team. At its most basic, you’ll have your coaching staff and players (or, who’s leading and conducting the testing process), your schedule (how often you test), and your gameplan (how you’ll conduct tests). Instead of using Xs and Os and other visual aids to run your plays, however, you’ll use pictures that help you tell which products will pass a quality check, which will fail, and why. The playbook will also outline the sample sizes you’ll test and define what percentage of defective products will signal the need to reject a whole batch.
Use your written explanation of ideal form, fit, and function to identify what imperfections to test for. These will fall into 1 of 3 categories: minor defect, major defect, or critical defect. For example, a scratch on a cocktail shaker might be considered a minor defect, while a warped shaker that doesn’t fit inside the other shaker could be deemed a critical defect. The amount of defects you find in your sample size will give you an idea about whether you can ship your products, need to do additional testing, or have to – sigh – reject the batch outright.
You can then come up with your own sample sizes and rejection thresholds, but the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) also has a standardized acceptance quality limit (AQL) sampling system for inspection by attributes. The AQL chart can be used to provide information and guidance on inspection levels, rejection thresholds, and sample sizes for individual shipments.
If this seems like a lot, it doesn’t have to be. You don’t want to go it alone when creating a quality acceptance document. Incorporate your supplier into the process.
“It only makes sense that your supplier agrees to everything in the document so that both parties are on the same page in terms of what is and is not acceptable,” Gonzalez says.
By having quality standards clearly laid out and agreed upon ahead of time, you reduce the risk of having a drawn-out dispute with your supplier over an unsatisfactory batch of product.
Striking the right balance on quality assurance can also be tricky. You have to take a bit of a Goldilocks approach with it. Too strict and you run the risk of rejecting too much product, which can lead to delays and stockouts. Too lax and defective products can end up making their way to customers, paving the way for negative reviews. Knowing early on what is realistic for your supplier to achieve from a quality standpoint can save you a lot of time and money down the road.
Oh … and if you’ve never built a quality acceptance document before, no problem.
Templates to help structure your document are available online.
Gonzalez strongly advises against relying on your manufacturer to carry out product inspections on your behalf. “You want an impartial inspector,” he says. “You need to insist on it. Otherwise, you can be left with a supplier who cuts corners when it comes to quality assurance in the hopes of avoiding rejects.” But, Gonzalez adds, there are a few things to keep in mind when looking for a solid third-party inspection company to partner with.
Third-party inspection companies need to be available on short notice. Our partner promises to have an agent on site and ready to conduct an inspection, anywhere in continental Asia, within 24 hours. This kind of flexibility is invaluable, as it minimizes delays across our vast network of suppliers. But even if you only have a few suppliers, if the past 2 years have taught us anything, it’s that unexpected delays and last-minute changes are a fact of life. Knowing that your third-party inspection company has the flexibility to swiftly react to these changes is a huge value-add.
Find an inspection company with top-notch technology platforms that allow you to quickly and easily access all of your inspection reports across your suppliers in real time. That’s especially helpful if you’ve got a lot of suppliers (and thus a lot of inspection reports).
Your third-party inspection company should be aligned with the material in your quality acceptance document. After all, they’ll be the ones carrying out the inspections. In their reports, data should be presented clearly and succinctly, allowing you to make quick, informed decisions on which products are ready to ship. A good inspection report will begin with a summary of the main findings, followed by detailed information to support those assessments. When vetting third-party inspection companies, it’s not a bad idea to ask them for sample reports to get a feel for how they present data.
Schedule inspections as soon as your products come off the line – the sooner the better. Why? That gives you time to course correct if there’s a problem. You don’t want to be caught with insufficient inventory because of extended retesting time frames or full-batch rejections.
There’s no “one size fits all” approach to quality assurance. Every product is unique. Even 2 sellers who sell a similar product may have different ideas about what quality testing should look like. And that’s OK. You’re taking steps that give your products the best chance to arrive on the doorsteps of your customers – exactly how they expect them to be.

Three of our brand owners share hot takes and takeaways after logging huge sales during Amazon’s fall event.
from Amazon’s Prime Early Access Sale (“PEAS”) is revealing that the products with big sales didn’t come with big price tags. For Thrasio, this meant the event and many of our brands went together like PEAS and carrots, with several of those brands having their best days yet.
In our new Q&A series “Best in Thras,” we teased out some reflections on PEAS with three questions for three Thrashers whose brands cooked the competition.
. It snatched a top spot in Lightning Deals and reached #2 best-seller status in pet supplies.
136,440 hours of colorful dancing flames keeping customers warm this winter.
™ glow-in-the-dark basketballs, footballs, and soccer balls. All three products simultaneously held the #1 best-seller spot during the sale, and the brand absolutely crushed it with sales 1,000% bigger than July’s Prime Day, for its biggest Prime Day yet.
Why was your brand successful during this event?
Choosing an attractive price point for our customers helps a lot.
In addition, we were able to obtain a lot of affiliate assistance for external traffic while leveraging coupons.
: We ran three Lightning Deals on the top Magical Flames listings, stacking them with coupons and exclusive discounts for affiliate/influencer partners, to create attractive final price points for our customers across all pack sizes. Additionally, leading into PEAS, we launched 600+ new Amazon PPC campaigns, which drove rank and sessions on key upper funnel keywords.
: We leaned into the available Amazon promotions, ran analysis of deals on those promotional prices, and had great discounts at a great time of year. Soccer, football and basketball seasons are all starting, it’s getting darker outside earlier and GlowCity is a great gift for the holidays.
How will you extend and/or learn from that success to have a strong Turkey 5?
: We will continue to push for brand recognition off of Amazon by working with affiliates, running Facebook ads, and leveraging TikTok – as well as YouTube soon.
for conversions and brand recognition while running a Top Deal. We are also making sure we are positioned with enough inventory to sell through November, December, and deals.
: Given the historical “stocking stuffer” appeal for Magical Flames, we will lean heavily into this theme heading into T5 via strategic copy updates, paid traffic campaigns, and affiliate/influencer coverage. Improving brand exposure for Magical Flames on these search terms will enable our Turkey 5 Lightning Deals to reach a larger set of customers. Furthermore, we will look beyond Turkey 5 to continue offering attractive deals up until the Christmas delivery cutoff.
: Inventory is not unlimited, so we’ll set specific deal unit limits to maintain healthy inventory throughout Q4.
On T5, a deal can really take off, which is great. But you want to make sure you leave inventory to capture higher margin sales from the “halo” effect of deals. On GlowCity, our sales were up nearly 100 percent the week following PEAS compared to the week before.
What piece of advice would you give to sellers coming out of PEAS?
: Leverage coupons and price your product to sell during high traffic events. Then ride the algorithm spike wave at a higher price point.
: Do not undersell the power of deal and coupon stacking when trying to improve your deals page placement. Stacked coupons may not be visible on the deals page, but they positively impact conversion, which bodes well with Amazon’s ranking algorithm.
: Nothing too extraordinary here; run some final optimization tests over the next few weeks (creative, copy, etc.), work to have strong keyword rank the week leading into T5, and utilize the promotions Amazon offers. Choose the promotions that match the goals for your products – promotions have varying discounts and expected lifts.

https://www.thrasio.com/resources/blog/external-traffic-amazon-attribution
------------------------
External traffic is critical to boosting sales and revenue from your Amazon listings. Measuring its performance is simple with this solution.
Rising PPC costs. Shifting consumer behavior. Increased competition. Just when you think you’ve got a handle on the best marketing strategy to drive sales to your Amazon FBA business, a new challenge pops up like some twisted game of Whac-A-Mole. That’s why it’s never been more important to have a comprehensive strategy that meets consumers wherever they are and is capable of handling new tests and surprises.
or preparing to sell, this tool will make your marketing efforts more fruitful and possibly increase the valuation of your company.
What is Amazon Attribution?
. Amazon Attribution is a solution created by Amazon to serve a similar need: the measurement of marketing channel performance on your site; in this case, that refers to non-Amazon marketing channel performance on your Amazon listing.
As you might know, advertisers are unable to place tracking pixels on their Amazon listings – so this tool is key to tracking your marketing performance. While still in beta, Amazon Attribution has been around for some time. It allows you to append URL parameters to your ads and pass information like campaign, ad group, channel, and publisher to the attribution console. This allows you to measure detailed product views (DPVs), add to carts (ATCs), units sold, total revenue, and more from your external traffic campaigns.
In addition to informing better ad spend decisions, Amazon Attribution ensures you have line of sight into conversions, which are paramount to ranking well in organic Amazon searches. Driving too much non-converting traffic to your listing risks hurting your Amazon SEO performance. In addition, advertisers receive a referral bonus from Amazon for every sale they generate via Amazon Attribution (more on this later).
.
From here you have two options: create the campaign manually or upload a file to create in bulk.
We recommend leveraging the bulk file creation flow if you’re starting with a paid search campaign. If you’re testing a paid social campaign you can use the manual creation flow.
Once you have the template you’ll want to create your campaign in the Google Ads editor and post it to Google/Bing as paused. From there you’ll need to download your keywords from Google and input the data into the bulk upload template columns below. Next, add the products you’d like to track in the products section.
Once the final URL suffix is added you’re ready to launch your campaign! There are also third-party tools that automate this process, but the manual flow is a great place to start if you’re using attribution for the first time.
As with any marketing tool, Amazon Attribution does have limitations. It’s important to note that once a campaign is launched it takes two full days for sales data to backfill completely. Because of this, we recommend ramping up campaigns gradually so you can optimize based on conversion data before really scaling up.
Amazon Attribution also uses a last-click attribution model with a 14-day look-back window. This model gives full credit for a sale or conversion to the touchpoint a customer last clicked on or engaged with before making a purchase. This is critical to keep in mind when analyzing campaign performance, because single-touch attribution models only tell part of the story.
Finally, to maintain user privacy Amazon masks conversion data for keywords that have not met the required daily click threshold. The banner below will indicate if you’re experiencing conversion masking in your campaigns.
This click threshold is cumulative, which means that viewing conversion data at the campaign level will provide the most accurate conversion amount for your campaigns. The click threshold is small but must be met for conversion data to appear. Conversions will not show at the ad group level if the particular ad group has not met that daily click threshold.
. On average, brands can earn a 10 percent bonus from qualifying sales simply by signing up. To calculate how much you may receive, multiply your qualifying sales from the relevant product category by the corresponding minimum bonus rate in the table below. Amazon now includes this amount in the reporting section of Attribution.
There is a two-month waiting period to receive the credit to your account, which accommodates order cancellations and customer returns. This bonus can really add up over time: one of our products, for example, generated $60k in referral bonus money over a seven-month period. The cherry on top? The bonus money also helps make leveraging external traffic easier for low-margin products.
Amazon Attribution is an easy tool to learn and a powerful way to keep growing your FBA business. The time you put into using it will easily pay off in the long run. Whether you’re currently running external campaigns or are planning to in the future, make sure to use it to track your sales.

When you’re looking for meaty advice as a CPG company owner, you don’t want the cheap cuts. You want the top of the line. Good news: We’re kicking off our webinars with Prime ... Day guidance.
sold worldwide and $3 billion spent on products from third-party small businesses. Many brands on the marketplace killed it, even if the macroeconomic uncertainty had some questioning their early strategy and decision-making. Now Amazon’s gearing up for another Prime Day in October – so, can lightning (deals) strike twice?
On Wednesday, Sept. 28, in the first episode of our new webinar series “For Your Own Goods,” three of Thrasio’s brand owners will help you prepare for another epic Amazon “holiday,” sharing insights from the successes they saw in July and advice on how your company can prepare for the sequel – or ride the wave and set the table for the Turkey 5.
We know what you’re thinking: Can you help me up my turkey game before November?
Scratch that: How will this webinar be different from the rest?
Host Sabina Raja, who shepherds the Zober brand of our YH Goods product line, will lead a conversation covering a wide range of topics with fellow brand owners Corey Gaarn and Will Moffett.
pillows over this summer’s event, Gaarn was instrumental to the bedding brand attaining 474% YOY sales growth, Amazon home page placement, and several editorial endorsements. The ChomChom pet hair roller, meanwhile, was also on the home page as a No. 1 trending deal and overall leader in the pet category, thanks to the work of Moffett and team members. They each bring a wealth of tactical knowledge on how to optimize your operations and sell at scale.
Sellers, come prepared to take notes and ask questions, because this discussion will hit on a number of learnings and key takeaways that can either be used over the next couple weeks or as part of a longer-term gameplan.
from 2-3 p.m. EDT Sept. 28 for this inaugural webinar and experience a taste of what’s in store “For Your Own Goods.” Our series will feature both internal Thrasio team members and external sellers talking about timely topics, providing advice on how to pivot when challenges arise, and breaking down the best long-term plans to grow your brand.

https://www.thrasio.com/resources/blog/secrets-to-omnichannel-and-retail
------------------------
Reeling in ecommerce sales takes skill. But to tackle new markets, you need new tools in your box. Our sales chief helps you cast a wider net.
Your megahit coffee frother nabbed the Amazon Best Seller Badge moooonths ago. In fact, your whole line of coffee products are buzzworthy category leaders. Revenue is up and so are your margins. Impressive? You bet. But your growth doesn’t have to stop there.
For businesses at the peak of their Amazon game, the next step is brewing up a strong omnichannel strategy.
What is omnichannel?
People often use the term “omnichannel” when they’re simply selling products through multiple marketplaces and channels – Amazon, direct to consumer (DTC), retail, and maybe social commerce. But the endgame for a true omnichannel strategy is complete integration, so that your markets, sales data, the customer experience, and the brand are all part of one intelligent ecosystem. Each piece plays a role in lifting the business and delivers a personalized experience to the customer.
notes that over 85% of shopping is still happening in physical stores.
Is your brand retail ready?
Your product has to be unique.
at a great price.
You need a gross profit margin of at least 50%.
Wholesaling can yield excellent gross margins – and more control over those margins. You set your price, and (in general) it sticks, which makes it different from selling through Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), says Esposito. “It’s not a daily battle to fix your price against your competitors’ pricing, which can lead you to a dangerous race to the bottom.” You’re also not paying FBA fees or pouring money into pay-per-click ads to get eyes on your product page. But you will be fulfilling your own wholesale orders and complying with unique terms associated with major retail. You’ll incur more operating costs due to shipping errors, product returns, payment terms, and many unique service requirements by retailer. So you’ve got to be able to maintain healthy profit margins before considering a run at retail.
Assume you’re going to sell your product to retailers at a wholesale price that is a 50% discount from your full FBA retail. Depending on the category of the product, that’s a good rule of thumb (also known as keystone pricing).
Do your research.
For certain categories, like cleaning supplies, there are more than a dozen national retailers that could sell your product. In other categories, like toys, you may only be able to place your product with three or four retailers – saturating your opportunities fairly quickly.
To test the waters, think about what kind of store you want your product to be in and why. What else is on the shelves in that store? What makes your product different from those other brands? What customers are you trying to reach? And why is your product going to make a difference in their lives?
The answers to these questions are going to guide your retail strategy – what stores you’re going after and how you’re going to craft your pitch to their buyers (but more on that later).
What are the drawbacks?
Supply chain is different for retail. You need to partner with a third-party logistics (3PL) company that can fulfill retail and have a systems infrastructure that connects you seamlessly to your 3PL and customer. You’ll be challenged to meet different compliance regulations or standards for both your products and packaging – and again, these challenges can and will differ by retailer. This may require legal advice or design expertise. Traditional retail triggers a fundamentally different operating structure than an FBA brand.
Managing supply chain and inventory is one of the biggest challenges of moving from FBA to an in-store environment. In retail in particular, stocking out is just not an option. Empty shelves are a retailer’s money-losing nightmare. If you miss orders, you could be hit with hefty chargebacks that could sink your brand, not to mention your reputation among buyers. If you become a headache for a buyer, you’ll lose their business for good.
In retail, people really do shop with their eyes first, which also means you need a great packaging designer who gets the voice of your brand and can make your product stand out on store shelves. The retail shopper is confronted by a sea of products and packaging, and you have a split second to attract their attention and highlight the uniqueness of your product!
So how do you get your products in front of buyers?
According to Esposito, there are a few ways you can get your foot in the door with retailers.
First, attend trade shows for your category. Say you’re in the pet category. Just start Googling “top pet retail trade shows,” find one that looks like it suits your product best, and sign up. You’ll meet a lot of mom and pop buyers, but you’ll also build your network and learn from other attendees. Esposito also recommends setting up an account on faire.com, which is like an Amazon for wholesalers.
Another approach would be to contact a manufacturer’s representative. Again, a Google search will bring up a number of experienced representatives who know the industry and have established relationships with the buyers you’re trying to get your product in front of. They tend to work on a 5% commission for major accounts, but the cost might be well worth the guidance they provide. You can also meet these reps at trade shows or through referrals.
Lastly, try good old-fashioned cold calling. If you have a successful “digitally native” brand and can tout a category leadership position with great reviews, most retail merchants will give you a look. Bombard them with samples and category knowledge and they may be your next best friend!
When an omnichannel strategy is firing on all cylinders, all the channels synergistically play a role in lifting overall sales and building brand equity. “We call it the flywheel effect,” says Esposito.
. The pet odor eliminator spray is on the shelves of many Target and PetSmart stores. Someone shopping for dog food in Target may see a bottle of Angry Orange pet odor eliminator and not initially buy it. But later, when they’re searching for pet odor eliminator products on their phone and Angry Orange appears with an average customer review rating of 4.4 out of 5 stars, the customer knows it’s a trusted brand. After they pull the trigger on a purchase, we can then retarget that customer for additional purchases of Angry Orange products through ads on Amazon and Google.
We first brought Angry Orange to a few hardware stores. Products flew off the shelves, and we were able to share that success as proof positive that Angry Orange could make money for other national retailers.
If you’re a top seller in your category, chances are you’ve got a great product. And getting that product into as many hands as possible means meeting customers where they are – on their computers, their phones, and yes – in brick-and-mortar stores too.

By selling quality hammocks at an affordable price, Wise Owl founder Sarah Douglass hopes to help people make more lasting memories in nature.
, Sarah Douglass, remembers the day that she and her husband, Todd, walked out of a national outdoors retailer with all the equipment they needed for a backpacking trip – and an eye-popping receipt for $2,500.
That bothered her. A lot.
To Sarah, nature was a place for restoration and rejuvenation. She felt that everyone should be able to experience that – and the price of admission to the Great Outdoors, by her calculation, should be as close as possible to free.
Plenty of people have thoughts like these. But most people don’t have the ability, tenacity, or audacity to act on those ideas, much less see them through to completion.
in both the camping and patio categories, along with camping pillows, bug nets, and a whole bevy of hammock accessories.
ven a GED. According to standard career advice, those are minimum requirements for professional success. Sarah Douglass didn’t get that memo.
Her family went to Hawaii once — the only “real” vacation they ever took. Other than that, it was twice-yearly trips to the Strawberry Music Festival in Camp Mather near Yosemite. Families pitched tents or strung hammocks between the pines. There was folk and bluegrass music and jam sessions going all day and night. Kids roamed the woods and spent hours swimming and crafting. The whole experience ended with a Sunday revival at Birch Lake. For her, the festival was the pinnacle of childhood happiness; for her family, it also happened to be a vacation that was pretty close to free.
Around 18, Sarah briefly decided to try her hand at school again. She became pregnant. And that was that. She started a new chapter as a single parent, working 2 or 3 jobs at a time to raise her son. Of course, it was hard.
Sarah spent plenty of years working for other people. A pattern emerged. She’d learn the business until she could pretty much run the business, then she’d ask for a big raise, and walk if she didn’t get one. She walked a few times. She was good at working, liked working – it was the working “for other people” part that needed changing. Along the way, Sarah met her now-husband, Todd, who shared a similar set of values, including a desire to strike out and build a business they could call their own.
But hammocks were a no-fuss piece of equipment that represented happiness to Sarah. Within a few minutes, people could be set up, relaxing, and listening to the gurgle of a stream, ocean waves, or a breeze in the trees. Hammocks were a way to get people enjoying nature fast, easy, and on the cheap.
Hammocks, as a product, also had some clear business advantages: they were relatively simple to manufacture and their compact size made them economical to ship. The fabric color and style options were endless, so they could always be on trend as customer tastes changed. Plus, Wise Owl could produce a lot of hammock accessories to eventually expand its product line.
From the stitching thread counts to the way the seams felt on bare skin (after all, customers might be using a hammock while wearing shorts or a swimsuit), Sarah and Todd left no detail unexamined.
Of the low-cost models, none passed the Sarah test. Too scratchy, too small, poorly made, too difficult to set up. She found one she did love – but it came with a nearly $100 price tag.
They had a mission for their new Amazon ecommerce business: Make the greatest hammock anyone ever owned at half the price.
When she was dreaming up the Wise Owl brand, Sarah created a script for a video ad. In her storyboards, she would proffer a Wise Owl hammock toward the camera and explain to viewers that what she was holding in her hand was not in fact a hammock at all… but happiness. Wise Owl was selling the feeling she had in childhood, what she wanted everyone to experience themselves.
In 2015, Sarah and Todd drew down their savings to place her first purchase order of 200 hammocks. The day the products arrived on her doorstep was another lesson in the challenges of building an Amazon ecommerce business. She opened the box and … the Wise Owl logo was the wrong color. Even worse, the hammocks were stuffed into long and skinny carrying sacks. “They were basically two-foot-long sausages,” she says. She pulled them all apart and paid a local seamstress to fix every logo patch and every sack.
Today, Wise Owl is a booming online Amazon ecommerce business. The hammocks are nearing 40,000 ratings and maintain an impressive average of 4.8. Wise Owl has earned dual Best Seller Badges in both the camping hammocks and patio hammocks categories, while its camping pillows and hammock bug net also have Best Seller Badges. In 2021 alone, the brand sold hundreds of thousands of units in its product line. At the end of 2021, the Camping Hammock was capturing the majority of the market share for camping hammocks on Amazon.
hammocks will launch in the Canadian, UK, and German Amazon markets – a huge expansion for what started as a small Amazon ecommerce business.

https://www.thrasio.com/resources/blog/build-an-fba-brand
------------------------
Every company has growing pains. To maintain a healthy outlook for your brand's future, don't overlook these key action items.
To strengthen the health of your FBA brand, it can pay to look beyond the bottom line. Have you grown a solid base of happy repeat customers? Or earned an avalanche of 5-star Amazon reviews for your products?  These are the kind of success markers that don’t directly appear on a profit and loss statement — but they can translate into higher customer lifetime value and a stronger FBA brand. In other words, to build an FBA brand with staying power, it helps to consider the big picture of your business.
Here are 4 strategies to think about.
If you’re used to thinking only about profit margin, you may want to start thinking about profit-dollars as well. Your goal should be to improve conversion rates and sales velocity on the products that provide the most bang for the buck in profit-dollars.
Conversion share is the number of times customers bought your product after searching with a given keyword, divided by the total number of times customers bought any product after searching with that same keyword. You want this number to grow over time. It shows you’re capturing a bigger slice of the pie linked to keywords associated with your product.
. The report is a gold mine of insights about your category and your FBA business.
to see which images perform best.
And yes, go for the video. A lot of people don’t incorporate video because it seems too hard or complex. Think of this: we’ve made very professional marketing videos with celebrities that have cost tens of thousands of dollars – and in some scenarios, those convert less than something made in 20 minutes on an iPhone. The lesson? It doesn’t have to be an insane production to be successful. It just needs to connect with customers.
Reviews are the lifeblood of an Amazon ecommerce business. You know this. When faced with an array of similar products, customers often default to the one with the most positive reviews. High-quality reviews start with a high-quality product, of course, but after that, you’ll need to do a little more work to earn your stars.
The work is well worth it. You want to create a moat of positive reviews around your products – an unbridgeable gap between your well-loved products and those of your closest competitors. And to increase your volume of positive reviews, you’ll need to increase your volume of sales. This may mean selling at a loss via a temporary price cut, running Amazon Deals, or increasing ad spending to boost traffic.

Lifelong Online’s co-founders built a powerhouse brand that put a dent in India’s appliance market. The secret to their success? Listen to who matters most – the customer.
market for ecommerce businesses. To be successful, brands must navigate the complexities of India’s delivery infrastructure. They also need to understand the diverse needs of Indian customers, what they want, how they shop, and what they value. In a country of 1.4 billion people, that is extraordinarily difficult.
Which is why the team charged with leading Thrasio’s foray into India are people who know what it takes to build a successful ecommerce brand there.
“It’s our customers, their stories, and their experiences with our products that really inspire me,” says Bharat Kalia, one the three co-founders and CEO of Lifelong Online (now called Lifelong, a Thrasio Company).
Kalia founded Lifelong in 2015 with two partners – Atul Raheja and Varun Grover. Since then, they’ve created more than 100 products, primarily in the kitchen-and-home, and health-and-fitness categories. Air fryers, stoves, stand mixers, treadmills, massagers, hair straighteners: a Lifelong product can be found in about a million homes in more than 500 cities.
The three founders of India-based company Lifelong, a Thrasio company.
But perhaps its biggest triumph is how Lifelong boldly entered the appliance market – a notoriously difficult category dominated by large, entrenched brands. “The products I was using in my home were the same my parents used,” Kalia says.
can be tucked behind a couch or under a bed – the ultimate solution for health-conscious Indians living in space-challenged homes. Today it is one of the best-selling products in the Lifelong line.
Or consider the case of Lifelong’s early version bicycle. Customers were frustrated with how much time and effort it took to put together. “People were saying ‘This is the hardest thing I ever did,’” Kalia says. The next version had just 5 moving parts and came 90% pre-assembled. Now they’re on version 3.
The customer is both king and queen at Lifelong.
A new product launch can involve 2 or 3 interactions with customers in a month, conversations that are coded and analyzed to ensure products are delivering happiness and satisfaction. “We analyze a ton of data and carefully codify our questions before making customer calls,” Kalia says.
This extraordinary openness to feedback goes back to Lifelong’s very first product, an oven toaster griller. In their enthusiasm, Kalia and the founders mounted a product listing before the product was actually ready. “We were super happy to get our first order,” Kalia says. “The problem was we only had a prototype.” He gave the customer a heads-up that the product was a bit of a work in progress – and then packed it up and mailed it across the country to the customer.
in less than prime condition. (“Basically, it was mangled,” Kalia says.) After multiple calls with the customer, Kalia delivered a new model to the customer within 2 weeks. After all that, the customer left Lifelong a positive review.
Lifelong’s employees hard at work building a next generation consumer goods company in India. Thrasio bought a majority share in Lifelong in January.
Lifelong’s goal of reaching every household in a country of 1.4 billion people will require keeping a careful eye on how the market is changing. People aren’t as tied to legacy brands as they once were, Kalia says, and younger generations are more comfortable with ecommerce.

, your gateway to building a better consumer goods company. Every edition, we’ll share stories, insights, and expertise on a topic critical to the industry. This issue: the importance of quality assurance and making sure the products you deliver truly deliver.
Talk about top shelf. Thrasio’s wildly popular pet odor eliminator spray Angry Orange now can be found at 1,750 Target stores, more than 1,500 PetSmart stores, more than 500 Ace/True Value Hardware stores – and continues to sell like hotcakes on Amazon, Walmart as well as the Angry Orange site. No matter where they shop, customers expect a product that’s best in show. After all, when your furry friend revenge-pees on your rug, you want nothing less than a blue-ribbon solution. That’s why we implement rigorous quality controls right where Angry Orange is made: at Toledo, Ohio-based Chempace Corporation. The result? A product that comes up smelling like roses – or rather oranges – every single time.
At Thrasio, we have quality assurance technicians, chemists, and engineers who continually improve upon products and processes. Why? So when customers try a Thrasio product, they’re delighted with the experience every single time.
Your customers expect the best. Here are 5 steps to build a strong quality assurance program and become more effective at preventing the defective.
Everyone’s been there. You buy a product that you’re excited to use, and then, when you need it, it fails to live up to its claims. Total headache. But for a business owner, one defective item can potentially set off a torrent of torment: a batch that has to be recalled, poor reviews that affect customer acquisition and loyalty, and even additional rounds of production. Fortunately, a strong quality assurance program can save the day, catching defective products before they ever ship to your customers.
If you don’t have a program in place, fear not: Axel Gonzalez has your back. Thrasio’s senior director of quality assurance and sustainability shares 5 steps to get you started.
Take, for example, the premium 10-piece bartender set Thrasio sells through our Mixology & Craft brand. It’s a showpiece with a premium price point. As such, its form can’t have scratches, dirty marks, or any flaws in its shape. Its strainer has to snugly fit inside the shaker so that no liquid leaks, while each piece must also fit in the display stand. And in order to meet Mixology & Craft’s goal of creating delicious cocktails, the shakers need to function as closed vessels that allow you to quickly mix ingredients together while simultaneously chilling the drink. This bartender set needs to bring your dreams of perfect libations to life.
Take some time to think about how form, fit, and function apply to your products. Literally make a list. This is the start of your quality assurance program, how you’ll begin to understand which attributes need to be assessed and tested. Depending on the complexity of your product, it could be a long list. But by clearly identifying what really matters to your products early on, you’ll set yourself up for a smooth operation and strong defense against trouble down the road.
Once you’ve decided what you’re going to test for, you need a resource to guide you through the process. Enter the quality acceptance document.
“The quality acceptance document is essentially the playbook that you will use to carry out your product inspections,” Gonzalez notes.
Picture a playbook for an NFL team. At its most basic, you’ll have your coaching staff and players (or, who’s leading and conducting the testing process), your schedule (how often you test), and your gameplan (how you’ll conduct tests). Instead of using Xs and Os and other visual aids to run your plays, however, you’ll use pictures that help you tell which products will pass a quality check, which will fail, and why. The playbook will also outline the sample sizes you’ll test and define what percentage of defective products will signal the need to reject a whole batch.
Use your written explanation of ideal form, fit, and function to identify what imperfections to test for. These will fall into 1 of 3 categories: minor defect, major defect, or critical defect. For example, a scratch on a cocktail shaker might be considered a minor defect, while a warped shaker that doesn’t fit inside the other shaker could be deemed a critical defect. The amount of defects you find in your sample size will give you an idea about whether you can ship your products, need to do additional testing, or have to – sigh – reject the batch outright.
You can then come up with your own sample sizes and rejection thresholds, but the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) also has a standardized acceptance quality limit (AQL) sampling system for inspection by attributes. The AQL chart can be used to provide information and guidance on inspection levels, rejection thresholds, and sample sizes for individual shipments.
If this seems like a lot, it doesn’t have to be. You don’t want to go it alone when creating a quality acceptance document. Incorporate your supplier into the process.
“It only makes sense that your supplier agrees to everything in the document so that both parties are on the same page in terms of what is and is not acceptable,” Gonzalez says.
By having quality standards clearly laid out and agreed upon ahead of time, you reduce the risk of having a drawn-out dispute with your supplier over an unsatisfactory batch of product.
Striking the right balance on quality assurance can also be tricky. You have to take a bit of a Goldilocks approach with it. Too strict and you run the risk of rejecting too much product, which can lead to delays and stockouts. Too lax and defective products can end up making their way to customers, paving the way for negative reviews. Knowing early on what is realistic for your supplier to achieve from a quality standpoint can save you a lot of time and money down the road.
Oh … and if you’ve never built a quality acceptance document before, no problem.
Templates to help structure your document are available online.
Gonzalez strongly advises against relying on your manufacturer to carry out product inspections on your behalf. “You want an impartial inspector,” he says. “You need to insist on it. Otherwise, you can be left with a supplier who cuts corners when it comes to quality assurance in the hopes of avoiding rejects.” But, Gonzalez adds, there are a few things to keep in mind when looking for a solid third-party inspection company to partner with.
Third-party inspection companies need to be available on short notice. Our partner promises to have an agent on site and ready to conduct an inspection, anywhere in continental Asia, within 24 hours. This kind of flexibility is invaluable, as it minimizes delays across our vast network of suppliers. But even if you only have a few suppliers, if the past 2 years have taught us anything, it’s that unexpected delays and last-minute changes are a fact of life. Knowing that your third-party inspection company has the flexibility to swiftly react to these changes is a huge value-add.
Find an inspection company with top-notch technology platforms that allow you to quickly and easily access all of your inspection reports across your suppliers in real time. That’s especially helpful if you’ve got a lot of suppliers (and thus a lot of inspection reports).
Your third-party inspection company should be aligned with the material in your quality acceptance document. After all, they’ll be the ones carrying out the inspections. In their reports, data should be presented clearly and succinctly, allowing you to make quick, informed decisions on which products are ready to ship. A good inspection report will begin with a summary of the main findings, followed by detailed information to support those assessments. When vetting third-party inspection companies, it’s not a bad idea to ask them for sample reports to get a feel for how they present data.
Schedule inspections as soon as your products come off the line – the sooner the better. Why? That gives you time to course correct if there’s a problem. You don’t want to be caught with insufficient inventory because of extended retesting time frames or full-batch rejections.
There’s no “one size fits all” approach to quality assurance. Every product is unique. Even 2 sellers who sell a similar product may have different ideas about what quality testing should look like. And that’s OK. You’re taking steps that give your products the best chance to arrive on the doorsteps of your customers – exactly how they expect them to be.

, your gateway to building a better consumer goods company. Every edition, we’ll share stories, insights, and expertise on a topic critical to the industry. This issue: the importance of quality assurance and making sure the products you deliver truly deliver.
Your customers expect the best. Here are 5 steps to build a strong quality assurance program and become more effective at preventing the defective.
Everyone’s been there. You buy a product that you’re excited to use, and then, when you need it, it fails to live up to its claims. Total headache. But for a business owner, one defective item can potentially set off a torrent of torment: a batch that has to be recalled, poor reviews that affect customer acquisition and loyalty, and even additional rounds of production. Fortunately, a strong quality assurance program can save the day, catching defective products before they ever ship to your customers.
If you don’t have a program in place, fear not: Axel Gonzalez has your back. Thrasio’s senior director of quality assurance and sustainability shares 5 steps to get you started.
Take, for example, the premium 10-piece bartender set Thrasio sells through our Mixology & Craft brand. It’s a showpiece with a premium price point. As such, its form can’t have scratches, dirty marks, or any flaws in its shape. Its strainer has to snugly fit inside the shaker so that no liquid leaks, while each piece must also fit in the display stand. And in order to meet Mixology & Craft’s goal of creating delicious cocktails, the shakers need to function as closed vessels that allow you to quickly mix ingredients together while simultaneously chilling the drink. This bartender set needs to bring your dreams of perfect libations to life.
Take some time to think about how form, fit, and function apply to your products. Literally make a list. This is the start of your quality assurance program, how you’ll begin to understand which attributes need to be assessed and tested. Depending on the complexity of your product, it could be a long list. But by clearly identifying what really matters to your products early on, you’ll set yourself up for a smooth operation and strong defense against trouble down the road.
Once you’ve decided what you’re going to test for, you need a resource to guide you through the process. Enter the quality acceptance document.
“The quality acceptance document is essentially the playbook that you will use to carry out your product inspections,” Gonzalez notes.
Picture a playbook for an NFL team. At its most basic, you’ll have your coaching staff and players (or, who’s leading and conducting the testing process), your schedule (how often you test), and your gameplan (how you’ll conduct tests). Instead of using Xs and Os and other visual aids to run your plays, however, you’ll use pictures that help you tell which products will pass a quality check, which will fail, and why. The playbook will also outline the sample sizes you’ll test and define what percentage of defective products will signal the need to reject a whole batch.
Use your written explanation of ideal form, fit, and function to identify what imperfections to test for. These will fall into 1 of 3 categories: minor defect, major defect, or critical defect. For example, a scratch on a cocktail shaker might be considered a minor defect, while a warped shaker that doesn’t fit inside the other shaker could be deemed a critical defect. The amount of defects you find in your sample size will give you an idea about whether you can ship your products, need to do additional testing, or have to – sigh – reject the batch outright.
You can then come up with your own sample sizes and rejection thresholds, but the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) also has a standardized acceptance quality limit (AQL) sampling system for inspection by attributes. The AQL chart can be used to provide information and guidance on inspection levels, rejection thresholds, and sample sizes for individual shipments.
If this seems like a lot, it doesn’t have to be. You don’t want to go it alone when creating a quality acceptance document. Incorporate your supplier into the process.
“It only makes sense that your supplier agrees to everything in the document so that both parties are on the same page in terms of what is and is not acceptable,” Gonzalez says.
By having quality standards clearly laid out and agreed upon ahead of time, you reduce the risk of having a drawn-out dispute with your supplier over an unsatisfactory batch of product.
Striking the right balance on quality assurance can also be tricky. You have to take a bit of a Goldilocks approach with it. Too strict and you run the risk of rejecting too much product, which can lead to delays and stockouts. Too lax and defective products can end up making their way to customers, paving the way for negative reviews. Knowing early on what is realistic for your supplier to achieve from a quality standpoint can save you a lot of time and money down the road.
Oh … and if you’ve never built a quality acceptance document before, no problem.
Templates to help structure your document are available online.
Gonzalez strongly advises against relying on your manufacturer to carry out product inspections on your behalf. “You want an impartial inspector,” he says. “You need to insist on it. Otherwise, you can be left with a supplier who cuts corners when it comes to quality assurance in the hopes of avoiding rejects.” But, Gonzalez adds, there are a few things to keep in mind when looking for a solid third-party inspection company to partner with.
Third-party inspection companies need to be available on short notice. Our partner promises to have an agent on site and ready to conduct an inspection, anywhere in continental Asia, within 24 hours. This kind of flexibility is invaluable, as it minimizes delays across our vast network of suppliers. But even if you only have a few suppliers, if the past 2 years have taught us anything, it’s that unexpected delays and last-minute changes are a fact of life. Knowing that your third-party inspection company has the flexibility to swiftly react to these changes is a huge value-add.
Find an inspection company with top-notch technology platforms that allow you to quickly and easily access all of your inspection reports across your suppliers in real time. That’s especially helpful if you’ve got a lot of suppliers (and thus a lot of inspection reports).
Your third-party inspection company should be aligned with the material in your quality acceptance document. After all, they’ll be the ones carrying out the inspections. In their reports, data should be presented clearly and succinctly, allowing you to make quick, informed decisions on which products are ready to ship. A good inspection report will begin with a summary of the main findings, followed by detailed information to support those assessments. When vetting third-party inspection companies, it’s not a bad idea to ask them for sample reports to get a feel for how they present data.
Schedule inspections as soon as your products come off the line – the sooner the better. Why? That gives you time to course correct if there’s a problem. You don’t want to be caught with insufficient inventory because of extended retesting time frames or full-batch rejections.
There’s no “one size fits all” approach to quality assurance. Every product is unique. Even 2 sellers who sell a similar product may have different ideas about what quality testing should look like. And that’s OK. You’re taking steps that give your products the best chance to arrive on the doorsteps of your customers – exactly how they expect them to be.

Wir sind stolz darauf mit unserem Können unsere erworbenen Marken auf eine neue Ebene zu bringen. Sehen Sie sich diese Fallstudien an, um zu erfahren, wie einzigartige Unternehmen unglaublich schnell und unglaublich stark wachsen konnten.
Wir haben ein kommerzielles Produkt in ein verbraucherfreundliches Produkt umgewandelt und den Umsatz von 2,5 Millionen Dollar auf 16,5 Millionen Dollar erhöht. In diesem Prozess wurde diese Marke so beliebt, dass sie über Amazon hinaus zusätzlich in Einzelhandelsgeschäften in den USA verkauft wurde.
Becky Cameron Home hat sich durch umfangreiche kreative Updates und Pay-per-Click (PPC) Initiativen für jedes einzelne Produkt von einem erfolgreichen Produkt zu einer vollendeten Marke entwickelt. Wir haben den Bestseller-Rang der Marke in weniger als drei Wochen um 95 % gesteigert.
Thrasio vergrößerte Crafts 4 All in nur zwei Jahren um das Dreifache mit einer dynamischen Verpackung, starkem PPC und einer erweiterten Produktlinie. Unser Geheimnis für die Aufrechterhaltung des Rankings Nr. 1? Niemals die Bestände ausgehen lassen.
ThisWorx war ursprünglich eine kleine Marke, die von einem erfolgreichen Produkt angeführt wurde. Thrasio verbesserte die Suchmaschinenoptimierung, aktualisierte die Fotos und Videos und gab einen kräftigen Marketingschub, um dieser Marke in nur wenigen Monaten zu einem durchschlagenden Erfolg zu verhelfen. Unser erstklassiges Markenmanagement sollte den Umsatz von ThisWorx bis 2021 verfünffachen.
Thrasio hat die PPC Kampagnen überarbeitet, großzügige Kundenservicemaßnahmen initiiert und TrailBuddy auf neue Märkte ausgeweitet — und damit die Marke zu einem globalen Erfolg geführt.

Während Thrasio expandiert, arbeiten wir hart daran, dass unser globales Bewusstsein noch schneller wächst. Unser Einfluss auf die Umwelt und die Gemeinden hilft uns bei der Entscheidungsfindung.
Im Rahmen unseres Programms für verantwortungsbewusste Beschaffung arbeiten wir mit dem weltweit führenden Wirtschaftsverband für offenen und nachhaltigen Handel amfori zusammen, um Instrumente und bewährte Verfahren zur Bewertung der sozialen Leistung unserer Lieferkette einzuführen. Die Lieferanten verpflichten sich, den amfori-Verhaltenskodex zu folgen, der 11 Grundsätze umfasst: von fairer Bezahlung bis zum Umweltschutz.
Im Rahmen unserer Initiative zur Nachhaltigkeit in der Lieferkette haben wir den Standard des Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol übernommen, um unsere Treibhausgasemissionen zu messen, zu verwalten und zu melden. Darüber hinaus haben wir uns mit Pathzero zusammengetan, um die GHG-Emissionen von Port-to-Port-Frachtgeschäften anhand der im Protokoll festgelegten Best Practices einzuschätzen.
Um die Gemeinschaften, in denen wir leben und arbeiten, zu stärken, haben wir bedeutsame, unterhaltsame und wirkungsvolle Mentoring- und philanthropische Möglichkeiten geschaffen.
Das Stipendium von Thrasio in Zusammenarbeit mit der Success Academy (SA) in Harlem bietet High-School-Schülern die Möglichkeit, von unseren Mitarbeitern zu lernen, wie man ein soziales Unternehmen von Grund auf recherchiert, aufbaut und erweitert. Stipendiaten arbeiten in Teams und werden nach mehreren Workshops mit Seed-Finanzierung belohnt, um in ihren Communitys mindestens ein akzeptables Produkt oder eine tragbare Dienstleistung zu starten. So wie Amazon es für kleine und mittlere Unternehmen (KMU) getan hat, hoffen wir auch, das Unternehmertum weiter zu demokratisieren, indem wir Studenten frühzeitig dazu inspirieren, ihr Potenzial als Unternehmer der Zukunft zu erkunden.
Mentorin bei BUILD zu sein, war eine sehr beeindruckende und aufschlussreiche Erfahrung. Es ist unglaublich zu sehen, mit welcher Leidenschaft ein Konzept in ein Produkt umgesetzt wird, auf das die Schüler stolz sind. Die Arbeit bei Thrasio gibt mir das Selbstvertrauen, diesen Studenten zu sagen, dass es eine Welt gibt, die ihren Unternehmergeist schätzt und ihre Lösungsfähigkeiten braucht.
Die Möglichkeit, meiner eigenen Mittelschule etwas zurückzugeben, war eine unglaubliche berufliche Leistung, die auch für mich persönlich sehr wichtig ist. Ich bin begeistert, dass ich in den Gemeinden, in denen ich aufgewachsen bin, etwas bewirken kann, und dass ich klugen jungen Köpfen neue Karrieremöglichkeiten eröffnen kann.
Wir ermutigen die Thrasher, unsere Politik der unbegrenzten bezahlten Freistellung zu nutzen und sich für die Themen einzusetzen, die ihnen am wichtigsten sind.
Machen Sie sich mit einer Gruppe positiver Menschen auf, die Zukunft zu gestalten.

Our leadership team is made up of Amazon veterans, e-commerce connoisseurs and successful entrepreneurs who are at the forefront of rethinking the way products are brought to the world.
Wer wagt, gewinnt. Josh Silberstein und Carlos Cashman verkörpern dieses Motto. Die beiden Thrasio Gründer trafen sich bei der Arbeit an einer Kampagne für die Schmuckmarke Bravelets von Stephanie Fox, die heute COO bei Thrasio ist. Trotz anfänglichen Erfolgen konnte die Marke aufgrund von externen Faktoren und mangelnden Ressourcen jedoch nie ihr volles Potenzial entfalten. Das brachte das Team auf eine Idee: Könnte man angeschlagene E-Commerce-Shops aufkaufen und diese mit Hilfe von skalierbaren Prozessen in die nächste Liga befördern? Gemeinsam wagten sie sich auf ein völlig neues Terrain vor. Dabei haben sie nicht nur den Amazon-Markt für Dritt-Anbieter aufgemischt, sondern eine komplett neue Branche geschaffen, deren Erfolg hunderte von Wettbewerbern hervorgebracht hat.

We bring products people love to the world.
At Thrasio, we’re reimagining how to make the world’s most-loved products accessible to everyone. So we work with successful sellers, using a deep understanding of rankings, ratings, and reviews – plus supply chain and marketing smarts – to transform the art and science of commerce.
We now feel like stronger business owners because we have a solid model for structuring any future brands we build — and can count on Thrasio to have our backs at any time.
I love how quickly Thrasio can move, how fair they are with their valuation, and how well they aligned with our vision. I returned to Thrasio to sell my second and third businesses.
Thrasio was able to consistently keep revenue strong through 2020 despite the numerous manufacturing, logistic, fulfillment constraints so many sellers faced during COVID. I don’t doubt they handled the account better than I could have myself given the same challenges.
Take a page from Thrasio’s playbook.
Actually, take 50 pages.
Get our book on getting your business ready for sale.
We make sure every Thrasio product delivered to your door delivers. And not just once, but every time, helping you make the most of every moment. It’s how we’ve become one of Amazon’s top 5 sellers.
If you’re looking to sell your Amazon business, we’re excited to work together.

We take pride in our ability to level up the ecommerce brands we acquire. Check out these case studies to see how unique companies all experienced incredible growth, incredibly fast.
We took a commercial-grade product and made it consumer ready, increasing revenue from $2.5 million to $16.5 million. In the process, this brand became so beloved, it expanded beyond Amazon to be sold in retail stores across the country.
Becky Cameron Home went from one successful product to a cohesive brand through expansive creative updates and pay-per-click (PPC) marketing initiatives for every single product. We increased the brand's Best Seller Rank by 95% in less than three weeks.
Thrasio grew Crafts 4 All over 3X in just 2 years with vibrant packaging, heavily invested PPC, and an expanded product line. Our secret to maintaining its #1 rank? Never run out of inventory.
ThisWorx was initially a small brand led by one successful product. Thrasio improved SEO, updated the photos and videos, and gave a hefty marketing push to make this brand a runaway success in only a few months. Our best-in-class brand management is slated to 5X ThisWorx revenue in 2021.
Thrasio revamped PPC, launched generous customer service initiatives, and brought TrailBuddy into new marketplaces—making this brand a global success.

As Thrasio expands across the world, we are committed to growing our global consciousness even faster. Our impact on the environment and the opportunity to lift people up help guide every decision we make.
Through our Responsible Sourcing Program, we partner with amfori, the leading global business association for open and sustainable trade, to implement tools and best practices that evaluate the social performance of our supply chain. Suppliers are committed to follow the amfori code of conduct – 11 principles ranging from fair payments to environmental protection.
As part of our Supply Chain Sustainability initiative, we’ve adopted the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol standard to measure, manage, and report our GHG emissions. We've also partnered with Pathzero to estimate GHG emissions from port-to-port freight operations, following best practices as specified in the Protocol.
To strengthen the communities in which we live and work, we’ve created meaningful, fun, and high-engagement mentorship and philanthropic opportunities.
Thrasio’s fellowship in collaboration with Success Academy (SA) in Harlem offers high school students the opportunity to learn from our employees how to research, build, and scale a social enterprise from scratch. Fellows work in teams and, after a series of workshops, are awarded seed funding to launch a minimum viable product or service in their communities. As Amazon has done for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), we also hope to further democratize entrepreneurship by inspiring students early on to explore their potential as the entrepreneurs of the future.
Being a mentor at BUILD has been a very humbling and eye-opening experience. It is incredible to see the passion that goes into developing a concept into a product that the students are proud of. Working at Thrasio gives me the confidence to tell these students that there is a world that values their entrepreneurial spirits and needs their problem-solving skills.
Being able to give back to my own middle school was an incredible professional accomplishment that’s also very important to me personally. I’m thrilled to be able to impact the communities where I grew up and to potentially introduce new career possibilities for bright young minds.
We encourage Thrashers to utilize our unlimited paid time off policy and take action on issues that are most meaningful to them.

Some say fortune favors the brave. Josh and Carlos’ good fortune started when they met while working on a purpose-driven jewelry brand called Bravelets, founded by current Thrasio COO Stephanie Fox. Though the company was initially successful, environmental factors and a lack of resources kept it from growing to its maximum potential. This gave them an idea: What if they could roll up struggling ecommerce companies into one portfolio and use a single set of operators and scalable processes to take them to the next level? Talk about entering a brave new world. Together, they disrupted the 3P marketplace on Amazon and established a category that has gone on to inspire hundreds of competitors.

Thrasio was able to consistently keep revenue strong through 2020 despite the numerous manufacturing, logistic, fulfillment constraints so many sellers faced during COVID. I don’t doubt they handled the account better than I could have myself given the same challenges.

We make sure every Thrasio product delivered to your door delivers. And not just once, but every time, helping you make the most of every moment. It’s how we’ve become one of Amazon’s top 5 sellers.

Some say fortune favors the brave. Josh and Carlos’ good fortune started when they met while working on a purpose-driven jewelry brand called Bravelets, founded by current Thrasio COO Stephanie Fox. Though the company was initially successful, environmental factors and a lack of resources kept it from growing to its maximum potential. This gave them an idea: What if they could roll up struggling ecommerce companies into one portfolio and use a single set of operators and scalable processes to take them to the next level? Talk about entering a brave new world. Together, they disrupted the 3P marketplace on Amazon and established a category that has gone on to inspire hundreds of competitors.

Wir haben ein kommerzielles Produkt in ein verbraucherfreundliches Produkt umgewandelt und den Umsatz von 2,5 Millionen Dollar auf 16,5 Millionen Dollar erhöht.

https://www.thrasio.com/for-sellers/case-studies/snuggle-pedic
------------------------
The founder of Snuggle-Pedic was a chiropractor-turned-entrepreneur who wanted to help his patients who suffered from chronic pain. After years of treating people with neck, back, and shoulder aches, he saw an opportunity. He designed pillows for optimal comfort while people slept, giving them healthier and more satisfying shut-eye. What was most impressive to us, however, was what set Snuggle-Pedic apart: a hero body pillow selling on a hot streak and standout features like Kool-Flow™ Tech, which allows air to travel through the pillow to help keep you cooler and sweat-free.
When Thrasio bought Snuggle-Pedic, we knew that staying atop the market would be a pillow fight. Why? The foam and fabric in the brand’s pillows are manufactured in the U.S. – which drives up both cost of goods sold and price points. We had to prove to customers that these pillows were worth the extra money by showcasing what makes them unique.
Customer reviews gave us insights into why people are softies for Snuggle-Pedic. The resulting brand strategy highlights the qualities customers want and love in the product line: the body fit of memory foam, the customizability of pillows shipped with an additional bag of fill material, and better breathability from covers with Kool-Flow Tech™. Even the Sandman would shell out for such luxuries.
Our creative team saw the brand’s star potential. Armed with a new SEO strategy, copywriters optimized listings and applied long-tail keywords. Team members added high-resolution photos and designers created graphics to show what sets Snuggle-Pedic pillows apart from competitors and how they support more comfortable sleep. The body pillow listing in particular saw improvements, including a 47% increase in sessions and an 18% jump in conversions within a year from acquisition.
Attracting bigger squads in the land of nod also means being everywhere potential customers are. Our PPC strategy allows us to be highly visible on Amazon. In addition to running Top Deals and Lightning Deals, we constantly strategize to be competitive in sponsored posts.
The result? Snuggle-Pedic regularly nabs top spots in search-results pages and frequently appears in Amazon’s “highly rated” products section. And the best part: we saw a 50% year-over-year increase in paid revenue from January-May 2021 to the same period in 2022, while PPC spend decreased 10% – highlighting our increasing efficiency.
Heading into the Turkey 5 – Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday – we focused on improving performance for hero listings by investing more resources into PPC, coupons, and affiliate promotions. The push positioned the hero listings on page 1 for priority keywords and drove a 369% increase in year-over-year revenue for that period. It also paved the way for a successful Thanksgiving Day Lightning Deal and better post-T5 daily profit.
Becky Cameron Home went from one successful product to a cohesive brand through expansive creative updates and pay-per-click marketing initiatives for every single product. We increased the brand's Best Sellers Rank by 95% in less than three weeks.

https://www.thrasio.com/for-sellers/case-studies/angry-orange
------------------------
Angry Orange, a pet-odor eliminator spray, was a 4-year-old brand generating more than $2 million in annual revenue when founder Adam St. George decided to exit the Amazon FBA game. Within a week of meeting the team at Thrasio, the deal was done.
This commercial-grade product was an impressive success, but the brand needed to become consumer-ready. The only logical move was a comprehensive rebrand of the entire Angry Orange product line.
To make the product consumer-ready, we completely revamped the packaging. A comprehensive rebrand of the Angry Orange product line told a story that also built consumer trust.
These improvements lent themselves to impactful listing optimizations, emphasizing the brand story and value within listing copy, imagery and video, and A+ content.
Thrasio’s marketing team built growth from both on-Amazon placements as well as off-Amazon, traffic-generating channels like Facebook and Google. With its high level of consumer interest, it was clear Angry Orange had the chops to grow into DTC channels as well, contributing 21% of total sales since March 2020. Thrasio’s marketing initiatives also included influencer marketing agreements, which have evolved to include celebrity endorsements.
The original 8oz Angry Orange concentrate was a hero product that earned a loyal cult following. Thrasio took product innovation to a new level by creating a ready-to-use version of the concentrate in multiple sizes, including a gallon jug. We expanded the product line to include a ready-to-use spray for stain removal and introduced a bathroom spray in early 2020.
Angry Orange has since experienced steady growth on Amazon. Thanks to our wholesale team, consumers also can find it on retail shelves. Select Target, Walmart, Ace Hardware, and True Value stores now sell Angry Orange to shoppers across the United States.

https://www.thrasio.com/for-sellers/case-studies/becky-cameron
------------------------
When Thrasio acquired Becky Cameron Home, the company’s hero product was well-ranked in the pillow category on Amazon and boasted 12,000 reviews. We built on this position by applying creative updates and rebuilding marketing initiatives from the ground up. This increased sales and a new inventory forecast – all part of a comprehensive brand strategy.
With more than 2,500 Amazon Standard Identification Numbers (ASINs), Becky Cameron Home was our largest brand acquisition to date. Our first order of business was to consolidate the product line to help drive sales velocity. We also knew we could save dramatically on costs by shoring up the supply chain.
Every Thrasher had a hand in this brand's success — combing through each listing to update creative, SEO title tags, and ensure each listing was Amazon TOS compliant. We also added two new suppliers and increased manufacturing capacity by 5X. We then built data set tools to help us manage a brand of this size and larger.
When we acquired Becky Cameron Home, the 2-Pack Gel Queen Pillow Set had the second-highest number of reviews in the category on Amazon. We significantly increased ad spend and optimized the listing from SEO to creative branding.
Many ASINs in this brand did not have a complete listing, which negatively affected SEO. For each listing, we updated branding with a new luxe feel and added 9 listing photos and A+ content to increase trust.
A robust marketing strategy for this brand held a big opportunity to help drive growth. Pay-per-click advertising was a huge part of that approach, with other efforts including Amazon events (e.g. Amazon Live), affiliate marketing, social media, and DTC.

https://www.thrasio.com/for-sellers/case-studies/crafts-4-all
------------------------
When we purchased Crafts 4 All, the hero product was already #1 in its category on Amazon. Thrasio built on that position by improving the brand's creative, investing heavily in pay-per-click marketing, and expanding the product line. Our supply chain team also went to work to ensure the brand never ran out of inventory – no small feat given the spike in demand caused by COVID-19.
Crafts 4 All presented a classic supply-and-demand challenge, but COVID-19 was the real hurdle to overcome. We dug deep into the manufacturing process and quickly found we'd need to shore up the brand's supply chain to ensure we could continue to make products no matter what disruption came next.
We leveraged the data and learnings from early COVID-19 supply chain scarcity into our forecasting for the 2020 holiday season. No longer constrained by on-hand inventory, we were able to sell freely in Q4 — pushing promotions and PPC for a sustained increase in sales continuing into 2021.
We packaged our top products to fit into a niche subcategory, which made it easier to consistently maintain top rank.
What can we say? We like being #1.
We launched an additional variation to the hero product. Offering three different sized kits at three different price points within an established listing drove sales with minimal impact on day-to-day operations.
Our updated branding added color to the packaging (and therefore the listing photos). Not only did the products stand out in the search results, they also made the kit a more giftable item. Our paint sets were one of the top-performing products in Q4 2020.

https://www.thrasio.com/for-sellers/case-studies/this-worx
------------------------
The owner of ThisWorx founded a small brand led by one popular product – a handheld car vacuum that customers loved. Thrasio built on that success by improving the brand's search engine optimization (SEO) strategies, adding professional photos and videos, and investing in a hefty marketing push. The result? The brand became a success in only a few months.
When we first acquired ThisWorx, we were neck-and-neck with another brand offering a very similar product. Thrasio needed to identify the competitive edge to our car vacuum.
ThisWorx Deal of the Day (DOTD) turned out to be the brand's first $1 million day. Since that first deal, we've built a strategy of running as many DOTDs as possible, supplementing with lightning deals in between. To date, ThisWorx has had six $1 million days and made over $20 million on deals alone.
We increased our vacuum’s price by 17% (from $29.97 to $34.99) to make running our deal strategy possible and drive sales. It also signaled to shoppers that ThisWorx products are built with more quality and longevity than our competitors' products.
ThisWorx sold more vacuums on Prime Day in 2020 than Thrasio's whole portfolio. We experienced 405% year-over-year increase on Prime Day and now have 47X more reviews since acquisition.
Our ThisWorx branding refresh included professional photography, upgraded packaging, and strategic copy – proving ThisWorx as the higher quality choice. We've maneuvered past the competition ever since.

https://www.thrasio.com/for-sellers/case-studies/trailbuddy
------------------------
When Thrasio acquired TrailBuddy — an outdoor brand with two separate storefronts — the company already had a solid reputation for making top-quality products. Both its trekking poles and boulder net products held Best Seller Badges and had strong Best Sellers Ranks in Amazon's sports & outdoor category. We immediately saw opportunities to build on TrailBuddy's position.
TrailBuddy was already a healthy brand, so the best path forward for growth was to increase visibility to shoppers. Thrasio revamped the brand's pay-per-click marketing strategies, launched generous customer service initiatives, and brought TrailBuddy into new global markets and online channels.
After wins in the U.S., Thrasio’s international team launched TrailBuddy trekking poles in Canada and the UK. The growth was impressive. In Canada, TrailBuddy reached the #1 Best Sellers Rank in under two weeks. On the third day in the UK market, TrailBuddy trekking poles reached #2 in search results.
We safeguarded the 4.7-star rating with generous customer service initiatives that go above and beyond customer expectations. Today, our customer obsession team has an average response time of about 2 hours. We also track trending customer suggestions for product improvements and immediately share that feedback with brand management to develop even stronger products in the future.
We took every advertisement opportunity Amazon offers with this brand. In the first year we owned the business, we made a 6-figure investment in pay-per-click marketing to build volume.
Our model allows us to make early strategic investments that lead to long-term gains for our brands.
After testing the quality and durability of our competitors’ products, we were confident TrailBuddy was a high-quality brand. That allowed us to experiment with new distribution and marketing strategies without the risk of sacrificing ratings and reviews. The data and insights we gained from that test-and-learn period now inform growth strategies for other brands in our portfolio.

https://www.thrasio.com/for-sellers/case-studies/beast-gear
------------------------
When Thrasio acquired Beast Gear – a UK-based fitness-equipment company – the owner had built personal connections with many of the brand's customers. Brand loyalty was impressive, but as the company grew, that level of engagement wasn’t scalable, and the competition was closing in.
Three months post-acquisition, COVID-19 hit, and demand for home-fitness equipment surged. That was good for Beast Gear – but demand for competitors' products also spiked, the supply chain was becoming unreliable, and Brexit was looming.
When Brexit came to a head in early 2021, pressure mounted on Amazon sellers operating in the EU. To serve both UK and EU customers, they had to find separate storage facilities and divvy up their inventory. Miss the deadline, and they’d face steep customs fees.
Thrasio’s Supply Chain, Finance, and Brand Management teams went to work for Beast Gear. In the face of unprecedented demand for shipping and warehousing, our teams revamped the inventory pipeline to meet the changing market conditions. They also created new listings for Amazon Europe.
When we purchased Beast Gear, its products were available in the United Arab Emirates and Australia, but storing and shipping merchandise to those markets cost more than they delivered in profit. We cut our losses there and focused on launching in the U.S., where forecasting showed a much stronger market.
Originally, Beast Gear had several independent listings for skipping ropes. By combining the listings and merging the ratings and reviews for each variation, Beast Gear Skipping Ropes quickly earned the Best Seller Badge.
To expand the brand’s consumer base, we pivoted the Beast Gear hyper-intense bodybuilder image to one with broader appeal. Thrasio’s Creative team replaced low-quality images and stock photos on its Amazon listings with professional product photography. The new look paid off when the pandemic drove people to look for simple, unintimidating home-fitness solutions.

https://www.thrasio.com/for-sellers/case-studies/cloud-massage
------------------------
Cloud Massage had been selling successfully on Amazon for over a year when Thrasio bought the brand. The hero product's unique appeal? Users can enjoy the foot-and-calf massager while sitting up, reclining, or lying down — whatever position they find most comfortable. We built on that success with an all-out marketing strategy to grow the brand.
In order to scale Cloud Massage, we increased inventory and more than doubled manufacturing capacity. We also kicked our growth strategy into high gear utilizing a mix of coupons, Amazon Deals, celebrity endorsements, and pay-per-click advertising efforts.
We started offering coupons for Cloud Massage right away. The strategy worked. The deep discounts incentivized conversions, and the brand’s sales velocity increased enough to make the product eligible for Amazon Deals. The brand's Best Sellers Rank improved significantly, it nabbed the Best Seller Badge, and then Cloud Massage was off to the races.
New photos, videos, and branding took Cloud Massage from being a well-liked product to a premium, Thrasio-worthy brand. With a fresh new logo, updated color palette, and messaging focusing on the product’s versatility, the brand began climbing the ranks in health and household categories.
Thanks to Thrasio’s Product Strategy & Development team, Cloud Massage will debut a new massage product in 2022. The new version is more technologically advanced, with a new user interface, soft-touch buttons, an auto-stop feature, and a remote control.
Over on the direct-to-consumer (DTC) side, we invested heavily in paid search, paid social, SEO, email campaigns, and affiliate marketing. The investment paid off. Sales on the brand’s site jumped from $100K in annual revenue to over $100K in weekly revenue. In 2021, the brand's DTC sales revenue on Black Friday nearly doubled its DTC earnings on the same day in 2020.

Some say fortune favors the brave. Josh and Carlos’ good fortune started when they met while working on a purpose-driven jewelry brand called Bravelets, founded by current Thrasio COO Stephanie Fox. Though the company was initially successful, environmental factors and a lack of resources kept it from growing to its maximum potential. This gave them an idea: What if they could roll up struggling ecommerce companies into one portfolio and use a single set of operators and scalable processes to take them to the next level? Talk about entering a brave new world. Together, they disrupted the 3P marketplace on Amazon and established a category that has gone on to inspire hundreds of competitors.

Während Thrasio expandiert, arbeiten wir hart daran, dass unser globales Bewusstsein noch schneller wächst. Unser Einfluss auf die Umwelt und die Gemeinden hilft uns bei der Entscheidungsfindung.
Im Rahmen unseres Programms für verantwortungsbewusste Beschaffung arbeiten wir mit dem weltweit führenden Wirtschaftsverband für offenen und nachhaltigen Handel amfori zusammen, um Instrumente und bewährte Verfahren zur Bewertung der sozialen Leistung unserer Lieferkette einzuführen. Die Lieferanten verpflichten sich, den amfori-Verhaltenskodex zu folgen, der 11 Grundsätze umfasst: von fairer Bezahlung bis zum Umweltschutz.
Im Rahmen unserer Initiative zur Nachhaltigkeit in der Lieferkette haben wir den Standard des Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol übernommen, um unsere Treibhausgasemissionen zu messen, zu verwalten und zu melden. Darüber hinaus haben wir uns mit Pathzero zusammengetan, um die GHG-Emissionen von Port-to-Port-Frachtgeschäften anhand der im Protokoll festgelegten Best Practices einzuschätzen.
Um die Gemeinschaften, in denen wir leben und arbeiten, zu stärken, haben wir bedeutsame, unterhaltsame und wirkungsvolle Mentoring- und philanthropische Möglichkeiten geschaffen.
Das Stipendium von Thrasio in Zusammenarbeit mit der Success Academy (SA) in Harlem bietet High-School-Schülern die Möglichkeit, von unseren Mitarbeitern zu lernen, wie man ein soziales Unternehmen von Grund auf recherchiert, aufbaut und erweitert. Stipendiaten arbeiten in Teams und werden nach mehreren Workshops mit Seed-Finanzierung belohnt, um in ihren Communitys mindestens ein akzeptables Produkt oder eine tragbare Dienstleistung zu starten. So wie Amazon es für kleine und mittlere Unternehmen (KMU) getan hat, hoffen wir auch, das Unternehmertum weiter zu demokratisieren, indem wir Studenten frühzeitig dazu inspirieren, ihr Potenzial als Unternehmer der Zukunft zu erkunden.
Mentorin bei BUILD zu sein, war eine sehr beeindruckende und aufschlussreiche Erfahrung. Es ist unglaublich zu sehen, mit welcher Leidenschaft ein Konzept in ein Produkt umgesetzt wird, auf das die Schüler stolz sind. Die Arbeit bei Thrasio gibt mir das Selbstvertrauen, diesen Studenten zu sagen, dass es eine Welt gibt, die ihren Unternehmergeist schätzt und ihre Lösungsfähigkeiten braucht.
Die Möglichkeit, meiner eigenen Mittelschule etwas zurückzugeben, war eine unglaubliche berufliche Leistung, die auch für mich persönlich sehr wichtig ist. Ich bin begeistert, dass ich in den Gemeinden, in denen ich aufgewachsen bin, etwas bewirken kann, und dass ich klugen jungen Köpfen neue Karrieremöglichkeiten eröffnen kann.
Wir ermutigen die Thrasher, unsere Politik der unbegrenzten bezahlten Freistellung zu nutzen und sich für die Themen einzusetzen, die ihnen am wichtigsten sind.
Machen Sie sich mit einer Gruppe positiver Menschen auf, die Zukunft zu gestalten.

As Thrasio expands across the world, we are committed to growing our global consciousness even faster. Our impact on the environment and the opportunity to lift people up help guide every decision we make.
Through our Responsible Sourcing Program, we partner with amfori, the leading global business association for open and sustainable trade, to implement tools and best practices that evaluate the social performance of our supply chain. Suppliers are committed to follow the amfori code of conduct – 11 principles ranging from fair payments to environmental protection.
As part of our Supply Chain Sustainability initiative, we’ve adopted the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol standard to measure, manage, and report our GHG emissions. We've also partnered with Pathzero to estimate GHG emissions from port-to-port freight operations, following best practices as specified in the Protocol.
To strengthen the communities in which we live and work, we’ve created meaningful, fun, and high-engagement mentorship and philanthropic opportunities.
Thrasio’s fellowship in collaboration with Success Academy (SA) in Harlem offers high school students the opportunity to learn from our employees how to research, build, and scale a social enterprise from scratch. Fellows work in teams and, after a series of workshops, are awarded seed funding to launch a minimum viable product or service in their communities. As Amazon has done for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), we also hope to further democratize entrepreneurship by inspiring students early on to explore their potential as the entrepreneurs of the future.
Being a mentor at BUILD has been a very humbling and eye-opening experience. It is incredible to see the passion that goes into developing a concept into a product that the students are proud of. Working at Thrasio gives me the confidence to tell these students that there is a world that values their entrepreneurial spirits and needs their problem-solving skills.
Being able to give back to my own middle school was an incredible professional accomplishment that’s also very important to me personally. I’m thrilled to be able to impact the communities where I grew up and to potentially introduce new career possibilities for bright young minds.
We encourage Thrashers to utilize our unlimited paid time off policy and take action on issues that are most meaningful to them.
Take off with a group of positive people out to define the future.

Our leadership team is made up of Amazon veterans, e-commerce connoisseurs and successful entrepreneurs who are at the forefront of rethinking the way products are brought to the world.
Wer wagt, gewinnt. Josh Silberstein und Carlos Cashman verkörpern dieses Motto. Die beiden Thrasio Gründer trafen sich bei der Arbeit an einer Kampagne für die Schmuckmarke Bravelets von Stephanie Fox, die heute COO bei Thrasio ist. Trotz anfänglichen Erfolgen konnte die Marke aufgrund von externen Faktoren und mangelnden Ressourcen jedoch nie ihr volles Potenzial entfalten. Das brachte das Team auf eine Idee: Könnte man angeschlagene E-Commerce-Shops aufkaufen und diese mit Hilfe von skalierbaren Prozessen in die nächste Liga befördern? Gemeinsam wagten sie sich auf ein völlig neues Terrain vor. Dabei haben sie nicht nur den Amazon-Markt für Dritt-Anbieter aufgemischt, sondern eine komplett neue Branche geschaffen, deren Erfolg hunderte von Wettbewerbern hervorgebracht hat.

In total, revenue during that period grew 133% over 2020, accounting for both existing brands and new acquisitions. Much of the growth was organic, with Thrasio brands handily outperforming 2020’s already-impressive results.

Thrasio erweitert den Horizont im Online-Handel. Wir wollen die beliebtesten Produkte aus aller Welt für jeden erreichbar machen. Hierfür arbeiten wir mit erfolgreichen E-Commerce-Unternehmen und Amazon FBA Sellern und nutzen unsere Expertise als Amazon-Aggregator, um ihre Geschäfte zu skalieren.

Wir sind bessere Unternehmer geworden, denn jetzt haben wir ein gutes Modell für die Entwicklung weiterer Marken – und wir können uns auf die Unterstützung durch Thrasio jederzeit verlassen.
Ich bin beeindruckt, wie schnell Thrasio ans Werk geht, wie fair ihr Angebot war und wie gut sie mit unserer Unternehmensvision übereinstimmen. Ich habe mein zweites und drittes Geschäft ebenfalls an Thrasio verkauft.
Thrasio war in der Lage, über das Jahr 2020 hinweg konstant hohe Umsatzzahlen zu generieren – und das trotz der zahlreichen COVID-Einschränkungen für Produktion, Logistik und Versand. Für mich besteht kein Zweifel, dass sie diesen Herausforderungen besser als ich gewachsen waren.
Unsere Produkte liefern, was wir versprechen. Mit jeder Lieferung wollen wir Ihre Erwartungen nicht nur erfüllen, sondern übertreffen. Auf diese Weise haben wir uns zu einem der Top 5 Amazon-Seller entwickelt.

We bring products people love to the world.
At Thrasio, we’re reimagining how to make the world’s most-loved products accessible to everyone. So we work with successful sellers, using a deep understanding of rankings, ratings, and reviews – plus supply chain and marketing smarts – to transform the art and science of commerce.
We now feel like stronger business owners because we have a solid model for structuring any future brands we build—and can count on Thrasio to have our backs at any time.
I love how quickly Thrasio can move, how fair they are with their valuation, and how well they aligned with our vision. I returned to Thrasio to sell my second and third businesses.
Thrasio was able to consistently keep revenue strong through 2020 despite the numerous manufacturing, logistic, fulfillment constraints so many sellers faced during COVID. I don’t doubt they handled the account better than I could have myself given the same challenges.
Take a page from Thrasio’s playbook.
Actually, take 50 pages.

We make sure every Thrasio product delivered to your door delivers. And not just once, but every time, helping you make the most of every moment. It’s how we’ve become one of Amazon’s top 5 sellers.

Three of our brand owners share hot takes and takeaways after logging huge sales during Amazon’s fall event.
from Amazon’s Prime Early Access Sale (“PEAS”) is revealing that the products with big sales didn’t come with big price tags. For Thrasio, this meant the event and many of our brands went together like PEAS and carrots, with several of those brands having their best days yet.
In our new Q&A series “Best in Thras,” we teased out some reflections on PEAS with three questions for three Thrashers whose brands cooked the competition.
. It snatched a top spot in Lightning Deals and reached #2 best-seller status in pet supplies.
136,440 hours of colorful dancing flames keeping customers warm this winter.
™ glow-in-the-dark basketballs, footballs, and soccer balls. All three products simultaneously held the #1 best-seller spot during the sale, and the brand absolutely crushed it with sales 1,000% bigger than July’s Prime Day, for its biggest Prime Day yet.
Why was your brand successful during this event?
Choosing an attractive price point for our customers helps a lot.
In addition, we were able to obtain a lot of affiliate assistance for external traffic while leveraging coupons.
: We ran three Lightning Deals on the top Magical Flames listings, stacking them with coupons and exclusive discounts for affiliate/influencer partners, to create attractive final price points for our customers across all pack sizes. Additionally, leading into PEAS, we launched 600+ new Amazon PPC campaigns, which drove rank and sessions on key upper funnel keywords.
: We leaned into the available Amazon promotions, ran analysis of deals on those promotional prices, and had great discounts at a great time of year. Soccer, football and basketball seasons are all starting, it’s getting darker outside earlier and GlowCity is a great gift for the holidays.
How will you extend and/or learn from that success to have a strong Turkey 5?
: We will continue to push for brand recognition off of Amazon by working with affiliates, running Facebook ads, and leveraging TikTok – as well as YouTube soon.
for conversions and brand recognition while running a Top Deal. We are also making sure we are positioned with enough inventory to sell through November, December, and deals.
: Given the historical “stocking stuffer” appeal for Magical Flames, we will lean heavily into this theme heading into T5 via strategic copy updates, paid traffic campaigns, and affiliate/influencer coverage. Improving brand exposure for Magical Flames on these search terms will enable our Turkey 5 Lightning Deals to reach a larger set of customers. Furthermore, we will look beyond Turkey 5 to continue offering attractive deals up until the Christmas delivery cutoff.
: Inventory is not unlimited, so we’ll set specific deal unit limits to maintain healthy inventory throughout Q4.
On T5, a deal can really take off, which is great. But you want to make sure you leave inventory to capture higher margin sales from the “halo” effect of deals. On GlowCity, our sales were up nearly 100 percent the week following PEAS compared to the week before.
What piece of advice would you give to sellers coming out of PEAS?
: Leverage coupons and price your product to sell during high traffic events. Then ride the algorithm spike wave at a higher price point.
: Do not undersell the power of deal and coupon stacking when trying to improve your deals page placement. Stacked coupons may not be visible on the deals page, but they positively impact conversion, which bodes well with Amazon’s ranking algorithm.
: Nothing too extraordinary here; run some final optimization tests over the next few weeks (creative, copy, etc.), work to have strong keyword rank the week leading into T5, and utilize the promotions Amazon offers. Choose the promotions that match the goals for your products – promotions have varying discounts and expected lifts.

------------------------
External traffic is critical to boosting sales and revenue from your Amazon listings. Measuring its performance is simple with this solution.
Rising PPC costs. Shifting consumer behavior. Increased competition. Just when you think you’ve got a handle on the best marketing strategy to drive sales to your Amazon FBA business, a new challenge pops up like some twisted game of Whac-A-Mole. That’s why it’s never been more important to have a comprehensive strategy that meets consumers wherever they are and is capable of handling new tests and surprises.
or preparing to sell, this tool will make your marketing efforts more fruitful and possibly increase the valuation of your company.
What is Amazon Attribution?
. Amazon Attribution is a solution created by Amazon to serve a similar need: the measurement of marketing channel performance on your site; in this case, that refers to non-Amazon marketing channel performance on your Amazon listing.
As you might know, advertisers are unable to place tracking pixels on their Amazon listings – so this tool is key to tracking your marketing performance. While still in beta, Amazon Attribution has been around for some time. It allows you to append URL parameters to your ads and pass information like campaign, ad group, channel, and publisher to the attribution console. This allows you to measure detailed product views (DPVs), add to carts (ATCs), units sold, total revenue, and more from your external traffic campaigns.
In addition to informing better ad spend decisions, Amazon Attribution ensures you have line of sight into conversions, which are paramount to ranking well in organic Amazon searches. Driving too much non-converting traffic to your listing risks hurting your Amazon SEO performance. In addition, advertisers receive a referral bonus from Amazon for every sale they generate via Amazon Attribution (more on this later).
.
From here you have two options: create the campaign manually or upload a file to create in bulk.
We recommend leveraging the bulk file creation flow if you’re starting with a paid search campaign. If you’re testing a paid social campaign you can use the manual creation flow.
Once you have the template you’ll want to create your campaign in the Google Ads editor and post it to Google/Bing as paused. From there you’ll need to download your keywords from Google and input the data into the bulk upload template columns below. Next, add the products you’d like to track in the products section.
Once the final URL suffix is added you’re ready to launch your campaign! There are also third-party tools that automate this process, but the manual flow is a great place to start if you’re using attribution for the first time.
As with any marketing tool, Amazon Attribution does have limitations. It’s important to note that once a campaign is launched it takes two full days for sales data to backfill completely. Because of this, we recommend ramping up campaigns gradually so you can optimize based on conversion data before really scaling up.
Amazon Attribution also uses a last-click attribution model with a 14-day look-back window. This model gives full credit for a sale or conversion to the touchpoint a customer last clicked on or engaged with before making a purchase. This is critical to keep in mind when analyzing campaign performance, because single-touch attribution models only tell part of the story.
Finally, to maintain user privacy Amazon masks conversion data for keywords that have not met the required daily click threshold. The banner below will indicate if you’re experiencing conversion masking in your campaigns.
This click threshold is cumulative, which means that viewing conversion data at the campaign level will provide the most accurate conversion amount for your campaigns. The click threshold is small but must be met for conversion data to appear. Conversions will not show at the ad group level if the particular ad group has not met that daily click threshold.
. On average, brands can earn a 10 percent bonus from qualifying sales simply by signing up. To calculate how much you may receive, multiply your qualifying sales from the relevant product category by the corresponding minimum bonus rate in the table below. Amazon now includes this amount in the reporting section of Attribution.
There is a two-month waiting period to receive the credit to your account, which accommodates order cancellations and customer returns. This bonus can really add up over time: one of our products, for example, generated $60k in referral bonus money over a seven-month period. The cherry on top? The bonus money also helps make leveraging external traffic easier for low-margin products.
Amazon Attribution is an easy tool to learn and a powerful way to keep growing your FBA business. The time you put into using it will easily pay off in the long run. Whether you’re currently running external campaigns or are planning to in the future, make sure to use it to track your sales.

https://www.thrasio.com/resources/blog/secrets-to-omnichannel-and-retail
------------------------
Reeling in ecommerce sales takes skill. But to tackle new markets, you need new tools in your box. Our sales chief helps you cast a wider net.
Your megahit coffee frother nabbed the Amazon Best Seller Badge moooonths ago. In fact, your whole line of coffee products are buzzworthy category leaders. Revenue is up and so are your margins. Impressive? You bet. But your growth doesn’t have to stop there.
For businesses at the peak of their Amazon game, the next step is brewing up a strong omnichannel strategy.
What is omnichannel?
People often use the term “omnichannel” when they’re simply selling products through multiple marketplaces and channels – Amazon, direct to consumer (DTC), retail, and maybe social commerce. But the endgame for a true omnichannel strategy is complete integration, so that your markets, sales data, the customer experience, and the brand are all part of one intelligent ecosystem. Each piece plays a role in lifting the business and delivers a personalized experience to the customer.
notes that over 85% of shopping is still happening in physical stores.
Is your brand retail ready?
Your product has to be unique.
at a great price.
You need a gross profit margin of at least 50%.
Wholesaling can yield excellent gross margins – and more control over those margins. You set your price, and (in general) it sticks, which makes it different from selling through Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), says Esposito. “It’s not a daily battle to fix your price against your competitors’ pricing, which can lead you to a dangerous race to the bottom.” You’re also not paying FBA fees or pouring money into pay-per-click ads to get eyes on your product page. But you will be fulfilling your own wholesale orders and complying with unique terms associated with major retail. You’ll incur more operating costs due to shipping errors, product returns, payment terms, and many unique service requirements by retailer. So you’ve got to be able to maintain healthy profit margins before considering a run at retail.
Assume you’re going to sell your product to retailers at a wholesale price that is a 50% discount from your full FBA retail. Depending on the category of the product, that’s a good rule of thumb (also known as keystone pricing).
Do your research.
For certain categories, like cleaning supplies, there are more than a dozen national retailers that could sell your product. In other categories, like toys, you may only be able to place your product with three or four retailers – saturating your opportunities fairly quickly.
To test the waters, think about what kind of store you want your product to be in and why. What else is on the shelves in that store? What makes your product different from those other brands? What customers are you trying to reach? And why is your product going to make a difference in their lives?
The answers to these questions are going to guide your retail strategy – what stores you’re going after and how you’re going to craft your pitch to their buyers (but more on that later).
What are the drawbacks?
Supply chain is different for retail. You need to partner with a third-party logistics (3PL) company that can fulfill retail and have a systems infrastructure that connects you seamlessly to your 3PL and customer. You’ll be challenged to meet different compliance regulations or standards for both your products and packaging – and again, these challenges can and will differ by retailer. This may require legal advice or design expertise. Traditional retail triggers a fundamentally different operating structure than an FBA brand.
Managing supply chain and inventory is one of the biggest challenges of moving from FBA to an in-store environment. In retail in particular, stocking out is just not an option. Empty shelves are a retailer’s money-losing nightmare. If you miss orders, you could be hit with hefty chargebacks that could sink your brand, not to mention your reputation among buyers. If you become a headache for a buyer, you’ll lose their business for good.
In retail, people really do shop with their eyes first, which also means you need a great packaging designer who gets the voice of your brand and can make your product stand out on store shelves. The retail shopper is confronted by a sea of products and packaging, and you have a split second to attract their attention and highlight the uniqueness of your product!
So how do you get your products in front of buyers?
According to Esposito, there are a few ways you can get your foot in the door with retailers.
First, attend trade shows for your category. Say you’re in the pet category. Just start Googling “top pet retail trade shows,” find one that looks like it suits your product best, and sign up. You’ll meet a lot of mom and pop buyers, but you’ll also build your network and learn from other attendees. Esposito also recommends setting up an account on faire.com, which is like an Amazon for wholesalers.
Another approach would be to contact a manufacturer’s representative. Again, a Google search will bring up a number of experienced representatives who know the industry and have established relationships with the buyers you’re trying to get your product in front of. They tend to work on a 5% commission for major accounts, but the cost might be well worth the guidance they provide. You can also meet these reps at trade shows or through referrals.
Lastly, try good old-fashioned cold calling. If you have a successful “digitally native” brand and can tout a category leadership position with great reviews, most retail merchants will give you a look. Bombard them with samples and category knowledge and they may be your next best friend!
When an omnichannel strategy is firing on all cylinders, all the channels synergistically play a role in lifting overall sales and building brand equity. “We call it the flywheel effect,” says Esposito.
. The pet odor eliminator spray is on the shelves of many Target and PetSmart stores. Someone shopping for dog food in Target may see a bottle of Angry Orange pet odor eliminator and not initially buy it. But later, when they’re searching for pet odor eliminator products on their phone and Angry Orange appears with an average customer review rating of 4.4 out of 5 stars, the customer knows it’s a trusted brand. After they pull the trigger on a purchase, we can then retarget that customer for additional purchases of Angry Orange products through ads on Amazon and Google.
We first brought Angry Orange to a few hardware stores. Products flew off the shelves, and we were able to share that success as proof positive that Angry Orange could make money for other national retailers.
If you’re a top seller in your category, chances are you’ve got a great product. And getting that product into as many hands as possible means meeting customers where they are – on their computers, their phones, and yes – in brick-and-mortar stores too.

By selling quality hammocks at an affordable price, Wise Owl founder Sarah Douglass hopes to help people make more lasting memories in nature.
, Sarah Douglass, remembers the day that she and her husband, Todd, walked out of a national outdoors retailer with all the equipment they needed for a backpacking trip – and an eye-popping receipt for $2,500.
That bothered her. A lot.
To Sarah, nature was a place for restoration and rejuvenation. She felt that everyone should be able to experience that – and the price of admission to the Great Outdoors, by her calculation, should be as close as possible to free.
Plenty of people have thoughts like these. But most people don’t have the ability, tenacity, or audacity to act on those ideas, much less see them through to completion.
in both the camping and patio categories, along with camping pillows, bug nets, and a whole bevy of hammock accessories.
ven a GED. According to standard career advice, those are minimum requirements for professional success. Sarah Douglass didn’t get that memo.
Her family went to Hawaii once — the only “real” vacation they ever took. Other than that, it was twice-yearly trips to the Strawberry Music Festival in Camp Mather near Yosemite. Families pitched tents or strung hammocks between the pines. There was folk and bluegrass music and jam sessions going all day and night. Kids roamed the woods and spent hours swimming and crafting. The whole experience ended with a Sunday revival at Birch Lake. For her, the festival was the pinnacle of childhood happiness; for her family, it also happened to be a vacation that was pretty close to free.
Around 18, Sarah briefly decided to try her hand at school again. She became pregnant. And that was that. She started a new chapter as a single parent, working 2 or 3 jobs at a time to raise her son. Of course, it was hard.
Sarah spent plenty of years working for other people. A pattern emerged. She’d learn the business until she could pretty much run the business, then she’d ask for a big raise, and walk if she didn’t get one. She walked a few times. She was good at working, liked working – it was the working “for other people” part that needed changing. Along the way, Sarah met her now-husband, Todd, who shared a similar set of values, including a desire to strike out and build a business they could call their own.
But hammocks were a no-fuss piece of equipment that represented happiness to Sarah. Within a few minutes, people could be set up, relaxing, and listening to the gurgle of a stream, ocean waves, or a breeze in the trees. Hammocks were a way to get people enjoying nature fast, easy, and on the cheap.
Hammocks, as a product, also had some clear business advantages: they were relatively simple to manufacture and their compact size made them economical to ship. The fabric color and style options were endless, so they could always be on trend as customer tastes changed. Plus, Wise Owl could produce a lot of hammock accessories to eventually expand its product line.
From the stitching thread counts to the way the seams felt on bare skin (after all, customers might be using a hammock while wearing shorts or a swimsuit), Sarah and Todd left no detail unexamined.
Of the low-cost models, none passed the Sarah test. Too scratchy, too small, poorly made, too difficult to set up. She found one she did love – but it came with a nearly $100 price tag.
They had a mission for their new Amazon ecommerce business: Make the greatest hammock anyone ever owned at half the price.
When she was dreaming up the Wise Owl brand, Sarah created a script for a video ad. In her storyboards, she would proffer a Wise Owl hammock toward the camera and explain to viewers that what she was holding in her hand was not in fact a hammock at all… but happiness. Wise Owl was selling the feeling she had in childhood, what she wanted everyone to experience themselves.
In 2015, Sarah and Todd drew down their savings to place her first purchase order of 200 hammocks. The day the products arrived on her doorstep was another lesson in the challenges of building an Amazon ecommerce business. She opened the box and … the Wise Owl logo was the wrong color. Even worse, the hammocks were stuffed into long and skinny carrying sacks. “They were basically two-foot-long sausages,” she says. She pulled them all apart and paid a local seamstress to fix every logo patch and every sack.
Today, Wise Owl is a booming online Amazon ecommerce business. The hammocks are nearing 40,000 ratings and maintain an impressive average of 4.8. Wise Owl has earned dual Best Seller Badges in both the camping hammocks and patio hammocks categories, while its camping pillows and hammock bug net also have Best Seller Badges. In 2021 alone, the brand sold hundreds of thousands of units in its product line. At the end of 2021, the Camping Hammock was capturing the majority of the market share for camping hammocks on Amazon.
hammocks will launch in the Canadian, UK, and German Amazon markets – a huge expansion for what started as a small Amazon ecommerce business.
, but like many entrepreneurs, she’s not really one to… just rest.

https://www.thrasio.com/resources/blog/build-an-fba-brand
------------------------
Every company has growing pains. To maintain a healthy outlook for your brand's future, don't overlook these key action items.
To strengthen the health of your FBA brand, it can pay to look beyond the bottom line. Have you grown a solid base of happy repeat customers? Or earned an avalanche of 5-star Amazon reviews for your products?  These are the kind of success markers that don’t directly appear on a profit and loss statement — but they can translate into higher customer lifetime value and a stronger FBA brand. In other words, to build an FBA brand with staying power, it helps to consider the big picture of your business.
Here are 4 strategies to think about.
If you’re used to thinking only about profit margin, you may want to start thinking about profit-dollars as well. Your goal should be to improve conversion rates and sales velocity on the products that provide the most bang for the buck in profit-dollars.
Conversion share is the number of times customers bought your product after searching with a given keyword, divided by the total number of times customers bought any product after searching with that same keyword. You want this number to grow over time. It shows you’re capturing a bigger slice of the pie linked to keywords associated with your product.
. The report is a gold mine of insights about your category and your FBA business.
to see which images perform best.
And yes, go for the video. A lot of people don’t incorporate video because it seems too hard or complex. Think of this: we’ve made very professional marketing videos with celebrities that have cost tens of thousands of dollars – and in some scenarios, those convert less than something made in 20 minutes on an iPhone. The lesson? It doesn’t have to be an insane production to be successful. It just needs to connect with customers.
Reviews are the lifeblood of an Amazon ecommerce business. You know this. When faced with an array of similar products, customers often default to the one with the most positive reviews. High-quality reviews start with a high-quality product, of course, but after that, you’ll need to do a little more work to earn your stars.
The work is well worth it. You want to create a moat of positive reviews around your products – an unbridgeable gap between your well-loved products and those of your closest competitors. And to increase your volume of positive reviews, you’ll need to increase your volume of sales. This may mean selling at a loss via a temporary price cut, running Amazon Deals, or increasing ad spending to boost traffic.

Lifelong Online’s co-founders built a powerhouse brand that put a dent in India’s appliance market. The secret to their success? Listen to who matters most – the customer.
market for ecommerce businesses. To be successful, brands must navigate the complexities of India’s delivery infrastructure. They also need to understand the diverse needs of Indian customers, what they want, how they shop, and what they value. In a country of 1.4 billion people, that is extraordinarily difficult.
Which is why the team charged with leading Thrasio’s foray into India are people who know what it takes to build a successful ecommerce brand there.
“It’s our customers, their stories, and their experiences with our products that really inspire me,” says Bharat Kalia, one the three co-founders and CEO of Lifelong Online (now called Lifelong, a Thrasio Company).
Kalia founded Lifelong in 2015 with two partners – Atul Raheja and Varun Grover. Since then, they’ve created more than 100 products, primarily in the kitchen-and-home, and health-and-fitness categories. Air fryers, stoves, stand mixers, treadmills, massagers, hair straighteners: a Lifelong product can be found in about a million homes in more than 500 cities.
The three founders of India-based company Lifelong, a Thrasio company.
But perhaps its biggest triumph is how Lifelong boldly entered the appliance market – a notoriously difficult category dominated by large, entrenched brands. “The products I was using in my home were the same my parents used,” Kalia says.
can be tucked behind a couch or under a bed – the ultimate solution for health-conscious Indians living in space-challenged homes. Today it is one of the best-selling products in the Lifelong line.
Or consider the case of Lifelong’s early version bicycle. Customers were frustrated with how much time and effort it took to put together. “People were saying ‘This is the hardest thing I ever did,’” Kalia says. The next version had just 5 moving parts and came 90% pre-assembled. Now they’re on version 3.
The customer is both king and queen at Lifelong.
A new product launch can involve 2 or 3 interactions with customers in a month, conversations that are coded and analyzed to ensure products are delivering happiness and satisfaction. “We analyze a ton of data and carefully codify our questions before making customer calls,” Kalia says.
This extraordinary openness to feedback goes back to Lifelong’s very first product, an oven toaster griller. In their enthusiasm, Kalia and the founders mounted a product listing before the product was actually ready. “We were super happy to get our first order,” Kalia says. “The problem was we only had a prototype.” He gave the customer a heads-up that the product was a bit of a work in progress – and then packed it up and mailed it across the country to the customer.
in less than prime condition. (“Basically, it was mangled,” Kalia says.) After multiple calls with the customer, Kalia delivered a new model to the customer within 2 weeks. After all that, the customer left Lifelong a positive review.
Lifelong’s employees hard at work building a next generation consumer goods company in India. Thrasio bought a majority share in Lifelong in January.
Lifelong’s goal of reaching every household in a country of 1.4 billion people will require keeping a careful eye on how the market is changing. People aren’t as tied to legacy brands as they once were, Kalia says, and younger generations are more comfortable with ecommerce.

, your gateway to building a better consumer goods company. Every edition, we’ll share stories, insights, and expertise on a topic critical to the industry. This issue: the importance of quality assurance and making sure the products you deliver truly deliver.
Your customers expect the best. Here are 5 steps to build a strong quality assurance program and become more effective at preventing the defective.
Everyone’s been there. You buy a product that you’re excited to use, and then, when you need it, it fails to live up to its claims. Total headache. But for a business owner, one defective item can potentially set off a torrent of torment: a batch that has to be recalled, poor reviews that affect customer acquisition and loyalty, and even additional rounds of production. Fortunately, a strong quality assurance program can save the day, catching defective products before they ever ship to your customers.
If you don’t have a program in place, fear not: Axel Gonzalez has your back. Thrasio’s senior director of quality assurance and sustainability shares 5 steps to get you started.
Take, for example, the premium 10-piece bartender set Thrasio sells through our Mixology & Craft brand. It’s a showpiece with a premium price point. As such, its form can’t have scratches, dirty marks, or any flaws in its shape. Its strainer has to snugly fit inside the shaker so that no liquid leaks, while each piece must also fit in the display stand. And in order to meet Mixology & Craft’s goal of creating delicious cocktails, the shakers need to function as closed vessels that allow you to quickly mix ingredients together while simultaneously chilling the drink. This bartender set needs to bring your dreams of perfect libations to life.
Take some time to think about how form, fit, and function apply to your products. Literally make a list. This is the start of your quality assurance program, how you’ll begin to understand which attributes need to be assessed and tested. Depending on the complexity of your product, it could be a long list. But by clearly identifying what really matters to your products early on, you’ll set yourself up for a smooth operation and strong defense against trouble down the road.
Once you’ve decided what you’re going to test for, you need a resource to guide you through the process. Enter the quality acceptance document.
“The quality acceptance document is essentially the playbook that you will use to carry out your product inspections,” Gonzalez notes.
Picture a playbook for an NFL team. At its most basic, you’ll have your coaching staff and players (or, who’s leading and conducting the testing process), your schedule (how often you test), and your gameplan (how you’ll conduct tests). Instead of using Xs and Os and other visual aids to run your plays, however, you’ll use pictures that help you tell which products will pass a quality check, which will fail, and why. The playbook will also outline the sample sizes you’ll test and define what percentage of defective products will signal the need to reject a whole batch.
Use your written explanation of ideal form, fit, and function to identify what imperfections to test for. These will fall into 1 of 3 categories: minor defect, major defect, or critical defect. For example, a scratch on a cocktail shaker might be considered a minor defect, while a warped shaker that doesn’t fit inside the other shaker could be deemed a critical defect. The amount of defects you find in your sample size will give you an idea about whether you can ship your products, need to do additional testing, or have to – sigh – reject the batch outright.
You can then come up with your own sample sizes and rejection thresholds, but the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) also has a standardized acceptance quality limit (AQL) sampling system for inspection by attributes. The AQL chart can be used to provide information and guidance on inspection levels, rejection thresholds, and sample sizes for individual shipments.
If this seems like a lot, it doesn’t have to be. You don’t want to go it alone when creating a quality acceptance document. Incorporate your supplier into the process.
“It only makes sense that your supplier agrees to everything in the document so that both parties are on the same page in terms of what is and is not acceptable,” Gonzalez says.
By having quality standards clearly laid out and agreed upon ahead of time, you reduce the risk of having a drawn-out dispute with your supplier over an unsatisfactory batch of product.
Striking the right balance on quality assurance can also be tricky. You have to take a bit of a Goldilocks approach with it. Too strict and you run the risk of rejecting too much product, which can lead to delays and stockouts. Too lax and defective products can end up making their way to customers, paving the way for negative reviews. Knowing early on what is realistic for your supplier to achieve from a quality standpoint can save you a lot of time and money down the road.
Oh … and if you’ve never built a quality acceptance document before, no problem.
Templates to help structure your document are available online.
Gonzalez strongly advises against relying on your manufacturer to carry out product inspections on your behalf. “You want an impartial inspector,” he says. “You need to insist on it. Otherwise, you can be left with a supplier who cuts corners when it comes to quality assurance in the hopes of avoiding rejects.” But, Gonzalez adds, there are a few things to keep in mind when looking for a solid third-party inspection company to partner with.
Third-party inspection companies need to be available on short notice. Our partner promises to have an agent on site and ready to conduct an inspection, anywhere in continental Asia, within 24 hours. This kind of flexibility is invaluable, as it minimizes delays across our vast network of suppliers. But even if you only have a few suppliers, if the past 2 years have taught us anything, it’s that unexpected delays and last-minute changes are a fact of life. Knowing that your third-party inspection company has the flexibility to swiftly react to these changes is a huge value-add.
Find an inspection company with top-notch technology platforms that allow you to quickly and easily access all of your inspection reports across your suppliers in real time. That’s especially helpful if you’ve got a lot of suppliers (and thus a lot of inspection reports).
Your third-party inspection company should be aligned with the material in your quality acceptance document. After all, they’ll be the ones carrying out the inspections. In their reports, data should be presented clearly and succinctly, allowing you to make quick, informed decisions on which products are ready to ship. A good inspection report will begin with a summary of the main findings, followed by detailed information to support those assessments. When vetting third-party inspection companies, it’s not a bad idea to ask them for sample reports to get a feel for how they present data.
Schedule inspections as soon as your products come off the line – the sooner the better. Why? That gives you time to course correct if there’s a problem. You don’t want to be caught with insufficient inventory because of extended retesting time frames or full-batch rejections.
There’s no “one size fits all” approach to quality assurance. Every product is unique. Even 2 sellers who sell a similar product may have different ideas about what quality testing should look like. And that’s OK. You’re taking steps that give your products the best chance to arrive on the doorsteps of your customers – exactly how they expect them to be.

Wir sind stolz darauf mit unserem Können unsere erworbenen Marken auf eine neue Ebene zu bringen. Sehen Sie sich diese Fallstudien an, um zu erfahren, wie einzigartige Unternehmen unglaublich schnell und unglaublich stark wachsen konnten.
Wir haben ein kommerzielles Produkt in ein verbraucherfreundliches Produkt umgewandelt und den Umsatz von 2,5 Millionen Dollar auf 16,5 Millionen Dollar erhöht. In diesem Prozess wurde diese Marke so beliebt, dass sie über Amazon hinaus zusätzlich in Einzelhandelsgeschäften in den USA verkauft wurde.
Becky Cameron Home hat sich durch umfangreiche kreative Updates und Pay-per-Click (PPC) Initiativen für jedes einzelne Produkt von einem erfolgreichen Produkt zu einer vollendeten Marke entwickelt. Wir haben den Bestseller-Rang der Marke in weniger als drei Wochen um 95 % gesteigert.
Thrasio vergrößerte Crafts 4 All in nur zwei Jahren um das Dreifache mit einer dynamischen Verpackung, starkem PPC und einer erweiterten Produktlinie. Unser Geheimnis für die Aufrechterhaltung des Rankings Nr. 1? Niemals die Bestände ausgehen lassen.
ThisWorx war ursprünglich eine kleine Marke, die von einem erfolgreichen Produkt angeführt wurde. Thrasio verbesserte die Suchmaschinenoptimierung, aktualisierte die Fotos und Videos und gab einen kräftigen Marketingschub, um dieser Marke in nur wenigen Monaten zu einem durchschlagenden Erfolg zu verhelfen. Unser erstklassiges Markenmanagement sollte den Umsatz von ThisWorx bis 2021 verfünffachen.
Thrasio hat die PPC Kampagnen überarbeitet, großzügige Kundenservicemaßnahmen initiiert und TrailBuddy auf neue Märkte ausgeweitet — und damit die Marke zu einem globalen Erfolg geführt.
Unsere Fallstudien dienen allgemeinen Informationszwecken; sie sind keine Garantien für künftige Leistungen und sollten nicht in unangemessener Weise herangezogen werden.

Während Thrasio expandiert, arbeiten wir hart daran, dass unser globales Bewusstsein noch schneller wächst. Unser Einfluss auf die Umwelt und die Gemeinden hilft uns bei der Entscheidungsfindung.
Im Rahmen unseres Programms für verantwortungsbewusste Beschaffung arbeiten wir mit dem weltweit führenden Wirtschaftsverband für offenen und nachhaltigen Handel amfori zusammen, um Instrumente und bewährte Verfahren zur Bewertung der sozialen Leistung unserer Lieferkette einzuführen. Die Lieferanten verpflichten sich, den amfori-Verhaltenskodex zu folgen, der 11 Grundsätze umfasst: von fairer Bezahlung bis zum Umweltschutz.
Im Rahmen unserer Initiative zur Nachhaltigkeit in der Lieferkette haben wir den Standard des Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol übernommen, um unsere Treibhausgasemissionen zu messen, zu verwalten und zu melden. Darüber hinaus haben wir uns mit Pathzero zusammengetan, um die GHG-Emissionen von Port-to-Port-Frachtgeschäften anhand der im Protokoll festgelegten Best Practices einzuschätzen.
Um die Gemeinschaften, in denen wir leben und arbeiten, zu stärken, haben wir bedeutsame, unterhaltsame und wirkungsvolle Mentoring- und philanthropische Möglichkeiten geschaffen.
Das Stipendium von Thrasio in Zusammenarbeit mit der Success Academy (SA) in Harlem bietet High-School-Schülern die Möglichkeit, von unseren Mitarbeitern zu lernen, wie man ein soziales Unternehmen von Grund auf recherchiert, aufbaut und erweitert. Stipendiaten arbeiten in Teams und werden nach mehreren Workshops mit Seed-Finanzierung belohnt, um in ihren Communitys mindestens ein akzeptables Produkt oder eine tragbare Dienstleistung zu starten. So wie Amazon es für kleine und mittlere Unternehmen (KMU) getan hat, hoffen wir auch, das Unternehmertum weiter zu demokratisieren, indem wir Studenten frühzeitig dazu inspirieren, ihr Potenzial als Unternehmer der Zukunft zu erkunden.
Mentorin bei BUILD zu sein, war eine sehr beeindruckende und aufschlussreiche Erfahrung. Es ist unglaublich zu sehen, mit welcher Leidenschaft ein Konzept in ein Produkt umgesetzt wird, auf das die Schüler stolz sind. Die Arbeit bei Thrasio gibt mir das Selbstvertrauen, diesen Studenten zu sagen, dass es eine Welt gibt, die ihren Unternehmergeist schätzt und ihre Lösungsfähigkeiten braucht.
Die Möglichkeit, meiner eigenen Mittelschule etwas zurückzugeben, war eine unglaubliche berufliche Leistung, die auch für mich persönlich sehr wichtig ist. Ich bin begeistert, dass ich in den Gemeinden, in denen ich aufgewachsen bin, etwas bewirken kann, und dass ich klugen jungen Köpfen neue Karrieremöglichkeiten eröffnen kann.
Wir ermutigen die Thrasher, unsere Politik der unbegrenzten bezahlten Freistellung zu nutzen und sich für die Themen einzusetzen, die ihnen am wichtigsten sind.
Machen Sie sich mit einer Gruppe positiver Menschen auf, die Zukunft zu gestalten.

Our leadership team is made up of Amazon veterans, e-commerce connoisseurs and successful entrepreneurs who are at the forefront of rethinking the way products are brought to the world.
Wer wagt, gewinnt. Josh Silberstein und Carlos Cashman verkörpern dieses Motto. Die beiden Thrasio Gründer trafen sich bei der Arbeit an einer Kampagne für die Schmuckmarke Bravelets von Stephanie Fox, die heute COO bei Thrasio ist. Trotz anfänglichen Erfolgen konnte die Marke aufgrund von externen Faktoren und mangelnden Ressourcen jedoch nie ihr volles Potenzial entfalten. Das brachte das Team auf eine Idee: Könnte man angeschlagene E-Commerce-Shops aufkaufen und diese mit Hilfe von skalierbaren Prozessen in die nächste Liga befördern? Gemeinsam wagten sie sich auf ein völlig neues Terrain vor. Dabei haben sie nicht nur den Amazon-Markt für Dritt-Anbieter aufgemischt, sondern eine komplett neue Branche geschaffen, deren Erfolg hunderte von Wettbewerbern hervorgebracht hat.

Dabei setzen wir auf erfahrene Amazon-Experten, umfassende SEO-Kenntnisse, Bewertungen und Rezensionen, bewährte Supply-Chain-Prozesse und innovative Marketingstrategien.
Wir sind bessere Unternehmer geworden, denn jetzt haben wir ein gutes Modell für die Entwicklung weiterer Marken – und wir können uns auf die Unterstützung durch Thrasio jederzeit verlassen.
Ich bin beeindruckt, wie schnell Thrasio ans Werk geht, wie fair ihr Angebot war und wie gut sie mit unserer Unternehmensvision übereinstimmen. Ich habe mein zweites und drittes Geschäft ebenfalls an Thrasio verkauft.
Thrasio war in der Lage, über das Jahr 2020 hinweg konstant hohe Umsatzzahlen zu generieren – und das trotz der zahlreichen COVID-Einschränkungen für Produktion, Logistik und Versand. Für mich besteht kein Zweifel, dass sie diesen Herausforderungen besser als ich gewachsen waren.
Unsere Produkte liefern, was wir versprechen. Mit jeder Lieferung wollen wir Ihre Erwartungen nicht nur erfüllen, sondern übertreffen. Auf diese Weise haben wir uns zu einem der Top 5 Amazon-Seller entwickelt.
Gemeinsam bringen wir Ihre Produkte groß raus.

We bring products people love to the world.
At Thrasio, we’re reimagining how to make the world’s most-loved products accessible to everyone. So we work with successful sellers, using a deep understanding of rankings, ratings, and reviews – plus supply chain and marketing smarts – to transform the art and science of commerce.
We now feel like stronger business owners because we have a solid model for structuring any future brands we build—and can count on Thrasio to have our backs at any time.
I love how quickly Thrasio can move, how fair they are with their valuation, and how well they aligned with our vision. I returned to Thrasio to sell my second and third businesses.
Thrasio was able to consistently keep revenue strong through 2020 despite the numerous manufacturing, logistic, fulfillment constraints so many sellers faced during COVID. I don’t doubt they handled the account better than I could have myself given the same challenges.
Take a page from Thrasio’s playbook.
Actually, take 50 pages.
Get our book on getting your business ready for sale.
We make sure every Thrasio product delivered to your door delivers. And not just once, but every time, helping you make the most of every moment. It’s how we’ve become one of Amazon’s top 5 sellers.
If you’re looking to sell your Amazon business, we’re excited to work together.

We take pride in our ability to level up the ecommerce brands we acquire. Check out these case studies to see how unique companies all experienced incredible growth, incredibly fast.
We took a commercial-grade product and made it consumer ready, increasing revenue from $2.5 million to $16.5 million. In the process, this brand became so beloved, it expanded beyond Amazon to be sold in retail stores across the country.
Becky Cameron Home went from one successful product to a cohesive brand through expansive creative updates and pay-per-click (PPC) marketing initiatives for every single product. We increased the brand's Best Seller Rank by 95% in less than three weeks.
Thrasio grew Crafts 4 All over 3X in just 2 years with vibrant packaging, heavily invested PPC, and an expanded product line. Our secret to maintaining its #1 rank? Never run out of inventory.
ThisWorx was initially a small brand led by one successful product. Thrasio improved SEO, updated the photos and videos, and gave a hefty marketing push to make this brand a runaway success in only a few months. Our best-in-class brand management is slated to 5X ThisWorx revenue in 2021.
Thrasio revamped PPC, launched generous customer service initiatives, and brought TrailBuddy into new marketplaces—making this brand a global success.
Our case studies are for general information purposes; they are not guarantees of future performance and undue reliance should not be placed on them. Each study is based on a particular set of facts and conditions at a point in time and may involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. The performance, financial results, and projections for the products or sellers in these case studies may not be parallel in others.

As Thrasio expands across the world, we are committed to growing our global consciousness even faster. Our impact on the environment and the opportunity to lift people up help guide every decision we make.
Through our Responsible Sourcing Program, we partner with amfori, the leading global business association for open and sustainable trade, to implement tools and best practices that evaluate the social performance of our supply chain. Suppliers are committed to follow the amfori code of conduct – 11 principles ranging from fair payments to environmental protection.
As part of our Supply Chain Sustainability initiative, we’ve adopted the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol standard to measure, manage, and report our GHG emissions. We've also partnered with Pathzero to estimate GHG emissions from port-to-port freight operations, following best practices as specified in the Protocol.
To strengthen the communities in which we live and work, we’ve created meaningful, fun, and high-engagement mentorship and philanthropic opportunities.
Thrasio’s fellowship in collaboration with Success Academy (SA) in Harlem offers high school students the opportunity to learn from our employees how to research, build, and scale a social enterprise from scratch. Fellows work in teams and, after a series of workshops, are awarded seed funding to launch a minimum viable product or service in their communities. As Amazon has done for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), we also hope to further democratize entrepreneurship by inspiring students early on to explore their potential as the entrepreneurs of the future.
Being a mentor at BUILD has been a very humbling and eye-opening experience. It is incredible to see the passion that goes into developing a concept into a product that the students are proud of. Working at Thrasio gives me the confidence to tell these students that there is a world that values their entrepreneurial spirits and needs their problem-solving skills.
Being able to give back to my own middle school was an incredible professional accomplishment that’s also very important to me personally. I’m thrilled to be able to impact the communities where I grew up and to potentially introduce new career possibilities for bright young minds.
We encourage Thrashers to utilize our unlimited paid time off policy and take action on issues that are most meaningful to them.
Take off with a group of positive people out to define the future.

Some say fortune favors the brave. Josh and Carlos’ good fortune started when they met while working on a purpose-driven jewelry brand called Bravelets, founded by current Thrasio COO Stephanie Fox. Though the company was initially successful, environmental factors and a lack of resources kept it from growing to its maximum potential. This gave them an idea: What if they could roll up struggling ecommerce companies into one portfolio and use a single set of operators and scalable processes to take them to the next level? Talk about entering a brave new world. Together, they disrupted the 3P marketplace on Amazon and established a category that has gone on to inspire hundreds of competitors.

Unser Ziel ist es, die besten Produkte schnell, intelligent und einfach in die Welt zu bringen. Wir nutzen unser Fachwissen, um einige der Top-Marken des Internets in bekannte Namen zu verwandeln.
Zu Beginn steht eine detaillierte Einschätzung des Potenzials einer Marke. Wenn wir eine Beziehung zu Ihnen aufbauen und Ihrem Unternehmen zu exponentiellem Wachstum verhelfen können, sind wir dabei – und bieten Ihnen dabei langfristige Gewinnbeteiligungen.
Wir unterziehen Ihre Marke einem strengen Prozess mit mehr als 500 Kontrollpunkten. Wir analysieren alles, von der Lieferkette über die Einhaltung von Vorschriften bis hin zum Marketing, und erstellen einen Plan, um das Wachstum Ihres Unternehmens zu fördern.

Wir nutzen unsere Erfahrung bei der Verbesserung von Zehntausenden von Produkten, um Ihrer Marke zum Durchbruch zu verhelfen.
Ihre Produkte verdienen es, Rockstars auf der größten Bühne zu sein. Als Top-5-Verkäufer optimieren wir Ihre Marke für die Plattform und machen Sie zu einer 5-Sterne-Kraft, die Ihnen hilft, Millionen von Menschen mit Best Seller Badges und Amazon's Choice-Rankings zu erreichen.

Our expert leadership team includes Amazon veterans, ecommerce mavens, and successful entrepreneurs at the forefront of rethinking how goods are brought to the world.
Some say fortune favors the brave. Josh and Carlos’ good fortune started when they met while working on a purpose-driven jewelry brand called Bravelets, founded by current Thrasio COO Stephanie Fox. Though the company was initially successful, environmental factors and a lack of resources kept it from growing to its maximum potential. This gave them an idea: What if they could roll up struggling ecommerce companies into one portfolio and use a single set of operators and scalable processes to take them to the next level? Talk about entering a brave new world. Together, they disrupted the 3P marketplace on Amazon and established a category that has gone on to inspire hundreds of competitors.

Während Thrasio expandiert, arbeiten wir hart daran, dass unser globales Bewusstsein noch schneller wächst. Unser Einfluss auf die Umwelt und die Gemeinden hilft uns bei der Entscheidungsfindung.
Im Rahmen unseres Programms für verantwortungsbewusste Beschaffung arbeiten wir mit dem weltweit führenden Wirtschaftsverband für offenen und nachhaltigen Handel amfori zusammen, um Instrumente und bewährte Verfahren zur Bewertung der sozialen Leistung unserer Lieferkette einzuführen. Die Lieferanten verpflichten sich, den amfori-Verhaltenskodex zu folgen, der 11 Grundsätze umfasst: von fairer Bezahlung bis zum Umweltschutz.
Im Rahmen unserer Initiative zur Nachhaltigkeit in der Lieferkette haben wir den Standard des Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol übernommen, um unsere Treibhausgasemissionen zu messen, zu verwalten und zu melden. Darüber hinaus haben wir uns mit Pathzero zusammengetan, um die GHG-Emissionen von Port-to-Port-Frachtgeschäften anhand der im Protokoll festgelegten Best Practices einzuschätzen.
Um die Gemeinschaften, in denen wir leben und arbeiten, zu stärken, haben wir bedeutsame, unterhaltsame und wirkungsvolle Mentoring- und philanthropische Möglichkeiten geschaffen.
Das Stipendium von Thrasio in Zusammenarbeit mit der Success Academy (SA) in Harlem bietet High-School-Schülern die Möglichkeit, von unseren Mitarbeitern zu lernen, wie man ein soziales Unternehmen von Grund auf recherchiert, aufbaut und erweitert. Stipendiaten arbeiten in Teams und werden nach mehreren Workshops mit Seed-Finanzierung belohnt, um in ihren Communitys mindestens ein akzeptables Produkt oder eine tragbare Dienstleistung zu starten. So wie Amazon es für kleine und mittlere Unternehmen (KMU) getan hat, hoffen wir auch, das Unternehmertum weiter zu demokratisieren, indem wir Studenten frühzeitig dazu inspirieren, ihr Potenzial als Unternehmer der Zukunft zu erkunden.
Mentorin bei BUILD zu sein, war eine sehr beeindruckende und aufschlussreiche Erfahrung. Es ist unglaublich zu sehen, mit welcher Leidenschaft ein Konzept in ein Produkt umgesetzt wird, auf das die Schüler stolz sind. Die Arbeit bei Thrasio gibt mir das Selbstvertrauen, diesen Studenten zu sagen, dass es eine Welt gibt, die ihren Unternehmergeist schätzt und ihre Lösungsfähigkeiten braucht.
Die Möglichkeit, meiner eigenen Mittelschule etwas zurückzugeben, war eine unglaubliche berufliche Leistung, die auch für mich persönlich sehr wichtig ist. Ich bin begeistert, dass ich in den Gemeinden, in denen ich aufgewachsen bin, etwas bewirken kann, und dass ich klugen jungen Köpfen neue Karrieremöglichkeiten eröffnen kann.
Wir ermutigen die Thrasher, unsere Politik der unbegrenzten bezahlten Freistellung zu nutzen und sich für die Themen einzusetzen, die ihnen am wichtigsten sind.
Machen Sie sich mit einer Gruppe positiver Menschen auf, die Zukunft zu gestalten.

As Thrasio expands across the world, we are committed to growing our global consciousness even faster. Our impact on the environment and the opportunity to lift people up help guide every decision we make.
Through our Responsible Sourcing Program, we partner with amfori, the leading global business association for open and sustainable trade, to implement tools and best practices that evaluate the social performance of our supply chain. Suppliers are committed to follow the amfori code of conduct – 11 principles ranging from fair payments to environmental protection.
As part of our Supply Chain Sustainability initiative, we’ve adopted the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol standard to measure, manage, and report our GHG emissions. We've also partnered with Pathzero to estimate GHG emissions from port-to-port freight operations, following best practices as specified in the Protocol.
To strengthen the communities in which we live and work, we’ve created meaningful, fun, and high-engagement mentorship and philanthropic opportunities.
Thrasio’s fellowship in collaboration with Success Academy (SA) in Harlem offers high school students the opportunity to learn from our employees how to research, build, and scale a social enterprise from scratch. Fellows work in teams and, after a series of workshops, are awarded seed funding to launch a minimum viable product or service in their communities. As Amazon has done for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), we also hope to further democratize entrepreneurship by inspiring students early on to explore their potential as the entrepreneurs of the future.
Being a mentor at BUILD has been a very humbling and eye-opening experience. It is incredible to see the passion that goes into developing a concept into a product that the students are proud of. Working at Thrasio gives me the confidence to tell these students that there is a world that values their entrepreneurial spirits and needs their problem-solving skills.
Being able to give back to my own middle school was an incredible professional accomplishment that’s also very important to me personally. I’m thrilled to be able to impact the communities where I grew up and to potentially introduce new career possibilities for bright young minds.
We encourage Thrashers to utilize our unlimited paid time off policy and take action on issues that are most meaningful to them.
Take off with a group of positive people out to define the future.

Our leadership team is made up of Amazon veterans, e-commerce connoisseurs and successful entrepreneurs who are at the forefront of rethinking the way products are brought to the world.
Wer wagt, gewinnt. Josh Silberstein und Carlos Cashman verkörpern dieses Motto. Die beiden Thrasio Gründer trafen sich bei der Arbeit an einer Kampagne für die Schmuckmarke Bravelets von Stephanie Fox, die heute COO bei Thrasio ist. Trotz anfänglichen Erfolgen konnte die Marke aufgrund von externen Faktoren und mangelnden Ressourcen jedoch nie ihr volles Potenzial entfalten. Das brachte das Team auf eine Idee: Könnte man angeschlagene E-Commerce-Shops aufkaufen und diese mit Hilfe von skalierbaren Prozessen in die nächste Liga befördern? Gemeinsam wagten sie sich auf ein völlig neues Terrain vor. Dabei haben sie nicht nur den Amazon-Markt für Dritt-Anbieter aufgemischt, sondern eine komplett neue Branche geschaffen, deren Erfolg hunderte von Wettbewerbern hervorgebracht hat.

Some say fortune favors the brave. Josh and Carlos’ good fortune started when they met while working on a purpose-driven jewelry brand called Bravelets, founded by current Thrasio COO Stephanie Fox. Though the company was initially successful, environmental factors and a lack of resources kept it from growing to its maximum potential. This gave them an idea: What if they could roll up struggling ecommerce companies into one portfolio and use a single set of operators and scalable processes to take them to the next level? Talk about entering a brave new world. Together, they disrupted the 3P marketplace on Amazon and established a category that has gone on to inspire hundreds of competitors.

Three of our brand owners share hot takes and takeaways after logging huge sales during Amazon’s fall event.
from Amazon’s Prime Early Access Sale (“PEAS”) is revealing that the products with big sales didn’t come with big price tags. For Thrasio, this meant the event and many of our brands went together like PEAS and carrots, with several of those brands having their best days yet.
In our new Q&A series “Best in Thras,” we teased out some reflections on PEAS with three questions for three Thrashers whose brands cooked the competition.
. It snatched a top spot in Lightning Deals and reached #2 best-seller status in pet supplies.
136,440 hours of colorful dancing flames keeping customers warm this winter.
™ glow-in-the-dark basketballs, footballs, and soccer balls. All three products simultaneously held the #1 best-seller spot during the sale, and the brand absolutely crushed it with sales 1,000% bigger than July’s Prime Day, for its biggest Prime Day yet.
Why was your brand successful during this event?
Choosing an attractive price point for our customers helps a lot.
In addition, we were able to obtain a lot of affiliate assistance for external traffic while leveraging coupons.
: We ran three Lightning Deals on the top Magical Flames listings, stacking them with coupons and exclusive discounts for affiliate/influencer partners, to create attractive final price points for our customers across all pack sizes. Additionally, leading into PEAS, we launched 600+ new Amazon PPC campaigns, which drove rank and sessions on key upper funnel keywords.
: We leaned into the available Amazon promotions, ran analysis of deals on those promotional prices, and had great discounts at a great time of year. Soccer, football and basketball seasons are all starting, it’s getting darker outside earlier and GlowCity is a great gift for the holidays.
How will you extend and/or learn from that success to have a strong Turkey 5?
: We will continue to push for brand recognition off of Amazon by working with affiliates, running Facebook ads, and leveraging TikTok – as well as YouTube soon.
for conversions and brand recognition while running a Top Deal. We are also making sure we are positioned with enough inventory to sell through November, December, and deals.
: Given the historical “stocking stuffer” appeal for Magical Flames, we will lean heavily into this theme heading into T5 via strategic copy updates, paid traffic campaigns, and affiliate/influencer coverage. Improving brand exposure for Magical Flames on these search terms will enable our Turkey 5 Lightning Deals to reach a larger set of customers. Furthermore, we will look beyond Turkey 5 to continue offering attractive deals up until the Christmas delivery cutoff.
: Inventory is not unlimited, so we’ll set specific deal unit limits to maintain healthy inventory throughout Q4.
On T5, a deal can really take off, which is great. But you want to make sure you leave inventory to capture higher margin sales from the “halo” effect of deals. On GlowCity, our sales were up nearly 100 percent the week following PEAS compared to the week before.
What piece of advice would you give to sellers coming out of PEAS?
: Leverage coupons and price your product to sell during high traffic events. Then ride the algorithm spike wave at a higher price point.
: Do not undersell the power of deal and coupon stacking when trying to improve your deals page placement. Stacked coupons may not be visible on the deals page, but they positively impact conversion, which bodes well with Amazon’s ranking algorithm.
: Nothing too extraordinary here; run some final optimization tests over the next few weeks (creative, copy, etc.), work to have strong keyword rank the week leading into T5, and utilize the promotions Amazon offers. Choose the promotions that match the goals for your products – promotions have varying discounts and expected lifts.

------------------------
External traffic is critical to boosting sales and revenue from your Amazon listings. Measuring its performance is simple with this solution.
Rising PPC costs. Shifting consumer behavior. Increased competition. Just when you think you’ve got a handle on the best marketing strategy to drive sales to your Amazon FBA business, a new challenge pops up like some twisted game of Whac-A-Mole. That’s why it’s never been more important to have a comprehensive strategy that meets consumers wherever they are and is capable of handling new tests and surprises.
or preparing to sell, this tool will make your marketing efforts more fruitful and possibly increase the valuation of your company.
What is Amazon Attribution?
. Amazon Attribution is a solution created by Amazon to serve a similar need: the measurement of marketing channel performance on your site; in this case, that refers to non-Amazon marketing channel performance on your Amazon listing.
As you might know, advertisers are unable to place tracking pixels on their Amazon listings – so this tool is key to tracking your marketing performance. While still in beta, Amazon Attribution has been around for some time. It allows you to append URL parameters to your ads and pass information like campaign, ad group, channel, and publisher to the attribution console. This allows you to measure detailed product views (DPVs), add to carts (ATCs), units sold, total revenue, and more from your external traffic campaigns.
In addition to informing better ad spend decisions, Amazon Attribution ensures you have line of sight into conversions, which are paramount to ranking well in organic Amazon searches. Driving too much non-converting traffic to your listing risks hurting your Amazon SEO performance. In addition, advertisers receive a referral bonus from Amazon for every sale they generate via Amazon Attribution (more on this later).
.
From here you have two options: create the campaign manually or upload a file to create in bulk.
We recommend leveraging the bulk file creation flow if you’re starting with a paid search campaign. If you’re testing a paid social campaign you can use the manual creation flow.
Once you have the template you’ll want to create your campaign in the Google Ads editor and post it to Google/Bing as paused. From there you’ll need to download your keywords from Google and input the data into the bulk upload template columns below. Next, add the products you’d like to track in the products section.
Once the final URL suffix is added you’re ready to launch your campaign! There are also third-party tools that automate this process, but the manual flow is a great place to start if you’re using attribution for the first time.
As with any marketing tool, Amazon Attribution does have limitations. It’s important to note that once a campaign is launched it takes two full days for sales data to backfill completely. Because of this, we recommend ramping up campaigns gradually so you can optimize based on conversion data before really scaling up.
Amazon Attribution also uses a last-click attribution model with a 14-day look-back window. This model gives full credit for a sale or conversion to the touchpoint a customer last clicked on or engaged with before making a purchase. This is critical to keep in mind when analyzing campaign performance, because single-touch attribution models only tell part of the story.
Finally, to maintain user privacy Amazon masks conversion data for keywords that have not met the required daily click threshold. The banner below will indicate if you’re experiencing conversion masking in your campaigns.
This click threshold is cumulative, which means that viewing conversion data at the campaign level will provide the most accurate conversion amount for your campaigns. The click threshold is small but must be met for conversion data to appear. Conversions will not show at the ad group level if the particular ad group has not met that daily click threshold.
. On average, brands can earn a 10 percent bonus from qualifying sales simply by signing up. To calculate how much you may receive, multiply your qualifying sales from the relevant product category by the corresponding minimum bonus rate in the table below. Amazon now includes this amount in the reporting section of Attribution.
There is a two-month waiting period to receive the credit to your account, which accommodates order cancellations and customer returns. This bonus can really add up over time: one of our products, for example, generated $60k in referral bonus money over a seven-month period. The cherry on top? The bonus money also helps make leveraging external traffic easier for low-margin products.
Amazon Attribution is an easy tool to learn and a powerful way to keep growing your FBA business. The time you put into using it will easily pay off in the long run. Whether you’re currently running external campaigns or are planning to in the future, make sure to use it to track your sales.

sold worldwide and $3 billion spent on products from third-party small businesses. Many brands on the marketplace killed it, even if the macroeconomic uncertainty had some questioning their early strategy and decision-making. Now Amazon’s gearing up for another Prime Day in October – so, can lightning (deals) strike twice?
On Wednesday, Sept. 28, in the first episode of our new webinar series “For Your Own Goods,” three of Thrasio’s brand owners will help you prepare for another epic Amazon “holiday,” sharing insights from the successes they saw in July and advice on how your company can prepare for the sequel – or ride the wave and set the table for the Turkey 5.
We know what you’re thinking: Can you help me up my turkey game before November?
Scratch that: How will this webinar be different from the rest?
Host Sabina Raja, who shepherds the Zober brand of our YH Goods product line, will lead a conversation covering a wide range of topics with fellow brand owners Corey Gaarn and Will Moffett.
pillows over this summer’s event, Gaarn was instrumental to the bedding brand attaining 474% YOY sales growth, Amazon home page placement, and several editorial endorsements. The ChomChom pet hair roller, meanwhile, was also on the home page as a No. 1 trending deal and overall leader in the pet category, thanks to the work of Moffett and team members. They each bring a wealth of tactical knowledge on how to optimize your operations and sell at scale.
Sellers, come prepared to take notes and ask questions, because this discussion will hit on a number of learnings and key takeaways that can either be used over the next couple weeks or as part of a longer-term gameplan.
from 2-3 p.m. EDT Sept. 28 for this inaugural webinar and experience a taste of what’s in store “For Your Own Goods.” Our series will feature both internal Thrasio team members and external sellers talking about timely topics, providing advice on how to pivot when challenges arise, and breaking down the best long-term plans to grow your brand.

https://www.thrasio.com/resources/blog/secrets-to-omnichannel-and-retail
------------------------
Reeling in ecommerce sales takes skill. But to tackle new markets, you need new tools in your box. Our sales chief helps you cast a wider net.
Your megahit coffee frother nabbed the Amazon Best Seller Badge moooonths ago. In fact, your whole line of coffee products are buzzworthy category leaders. Revenue is up and so are your margins. Impressive? You bet. But your growth doesn’t have to stop there.
For businesses at the peak of their Amazon game, the next step is brewing up a strong omnichannel strategy.
What is omnichannel?
People often use the term “omnichannel” when they’re simply selling products through multiple marketplaces and channels – Amazon, direct to consumer (DTC), retail, and maybe social commerce. But the endgame for a true omnichannel strategy is complete integration, so that your markets, sales data, the customer experience, and the brand are all part of one intelligent ecosystem. Each piece plays a role in lifting the business and delivers a personalized experience to the customer.
notes that over 85% of shopping is still happening in physical stores.
Is your brand retail ready?
Your product has to be unique.
at a great price.
You need a gross profit margin of at least 50%.
Wholesaling can yield excellent gross margins – and more control over those margins. You set your price, and (in general) it sticks, which makes it different from selling through Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), says Esposito. “It’s not a daily battle to fix your price against your competitors’ pricing, which can lead you to a dangerous race to the bottom.” You’re also not paying FBA fees or pouring money into pay-per-click ads to get eyes on your product page. But you will be fulfilling your own wholesale orders and complying with unique terms associated with major retail. You’ll incur more operating costs due to shipping errors, product returns, payment terms, and many unique service requirements by retailer. So you’ve got to be able to maintain healthy profit margins before considering a run at retail.
Assume you’re going to sell your product to retailers at a wholesale price that is a 50% discount from your full FBA retail. Depending on the category of the product, that’s a good rule of thumb (also known as keystone pricing).
Do your research.
For certain categories, like cleaning supplies, there are more than a dozen national retailers that could sell your product. In other categories, like toys, you may only be able to place your product with three or four retailers – saturating your opportunities fairly quickly.
To test the waters, think about what kind of store you want your product to be in and why. What else is on the shelves in that store? What makes your product different from those other brands? What customers are you trying to reach? And why is your product going to make a difference in their lives?
The answers to these questions are going to guide your retail strategy – what stores you’re going after and how you’re going to craft your pitch to their buyers (but more on that later).
What are the drawbacks?
Supply chain is different for retail. You need to partner with a third-party logistics (3PL) company that can fulfill retail and have a systems infrastructure that connects you seamlessly to your 3PL and customer. You’ll be challenged to meet different compliance regulations or standards for both your products and packaging – and again, these challenges can and will differ by retailer. This may require legal advice or design expertise. Traditional retail triggers a fundamentally different operating structure than an FBA brand.
Managing supply chain and inventory is one of the biggest challenges of moving from FBA to an in-store environment. In retail in particular, stocking out is just not an option. Empty shelves are a retailer’s money-losing nightmare. If you miss orders, you could be hit with hefty chargebacks that could sink your brand, not to mention your reputation among buyers. If you become a headache for a buyer, you’ll lose their business for good.
In retail, people really do shop with their eyes first, which also means you need a great packaging designer who gets the voice of your brand and can make your product stand out on store shelves. The retail shopper is confronted by a sea of products and packaging, and you have a split second to attract their attention and highlight the uniqueness of your product!
So how do you get your products in front of buyers?
According to Esposito, there are a few ways you can get your foot in the door with retailers.
First, attend trade shows for your category. Say you’re in the pet category. Just start Googling “top pet retail trade shows,” find one that looks like it suits your product best, and sign up. You’ll meet a lot of mom and pop buyers, but you’ll also build your network and learn from other attendees. Esposito also recommends setting up an account on faire.com, which is like an Amazon for wholesalers.
Another approach would be to contact a manufacturer’s representative. Again, a Google search will bring up a number of experienced representatives who know the industry and have established relationships with the buyers you’re trying to get your product in front of. They tend to work on a 5% commission for major accounts, but the cost might be well worth the guidance they provide. You can also meet these reps at trade shows or through referrals.
Lastly, try good old-fashioned cold calling. If you have a successful “digitally native” brand and can tout a category leadership position with great reviews, most retail merchants will give you a look. Bombard them with samples and category knowledge and they may be your next best friend!
When an omnichannel strategy is firing on all cylinders, all the channels synergistically play a role in lifting overall sales and building brand equity. “We call it the flywheel effect,” says Esposito.
. The pet odor eliminator spray is on the shelves of many Target and PetSmart stores. Someone shopping for dog food in Target may see a bottle of Angry Orange pet odor eliminator and not initially buy it. But later, when they’re searching for pet odor eliminator products on their phone and Angry Orange appears with an average customer review rating of 4.4 out of 5 stars, the customer knows it’s a trusted brand. After they pull the trigger on a purchase, we can then retarget that customer for additional purchases of Angry Orange products through ads on Amazon and Google.
We first brought Angry Orange to a few hardware stores. Products flew off the shelves, and we were able to share that success as proof positive that Angry Orange could make money for other national retailers.
If you’re a top seller in your category, chances are you’ve got a great product. And getting that product into as many hands as possible means meeting customers where they are – on their computers, their phones, and yes – in brick-and-mortar stores too.

By selling quality hammocks at an affordable price, Wise Owl founder Sarah Douglass hopes to help people make more lasting memories in nature.
, Sarah Douglass, remembers the day that she and her husband, Todd, walked out of a national outdoors retailer with all the equipment they needed for a backpacking trip – and an eye-popping receipt for $2,500.
That bothered her. A lot.
To Sarah, nature was a place for restoration and rejuvenation. She felt that everyone should be able to experience that – and the price of admission to the Great Outdoors, by her calculation, should be as close as possible to free.
Plenty of people have thoughts like these. But most people don’t have the ability, tenacity, or audacity to act on those ideas, much less see them through to completion.
in both the camping and patio categories, along with camping pillows, bug nets, and a whole bevy of hammock accessories.
ven a GED. According to standard career advice, those are minimum requirements for professional success. Sarah Douglass didn’t get that memo.
Her family went to Hawaii once — the only “real” vacation they ever took. Other than that, it was twice-yearly trips to the Strawberry Music Festival in Camp Mather near Yosemite. Families pitched tents or strung hammocks between the pines. There was folk and bluegrass music and jam sessions going all day and night. Kids roamed the woods and spent hours swimming and crafting. The whole experience ended with a Sunday revival at Birch Lake. For her, the festival was the pinnacle of childhood happiness; for her family, it also happened to be a vacation that was pretty close to free.
Around 18, Sarah briefly decided to try her hand at school again. She became pregnant. And that was that. She started a new chapter as a single parent, working 2 or 3 jobs at a time to raise her son. Of course, it was hard.
Sarah spent plenty of years working for other people. A pattern emerged. She’d learn the business until she could pretty much run the business, then she’d ask for a big raise, and walk if she didn’t get one. She walked a few times. She was good at working, liked working – it was the working “for other people” part that needed changing. Along the way, Sarah met her now-husband, Todd, who shared a similar set of values, including a desire to strike out and build a business they could call their own.
But hammocks were a no-fuss piece of equipment that represented happiness to Sarah. Within a few minutes, people could be set up, relaxing, and listening to the gurgle of a stream, ocean waves, or a breeze in the trees. Hammocks were a way to get people enjoying nature fast, easy, and on the cheap.
Hammocks, as a product, also had some clear business advantages: they were relatively simple to manufacture and their compact size made them economical to ship. The fabric color and style options were endless, so they could always be on trend as customer tastes changed. Plus, Wise Owl could produce a lot of hammock accessories to eventually expand its product line.
From the stitching thread counts to the way the seams felt on bare skin (after all, customers might be using a hammock while wearing shorts or a swimsuit), Sarah and Todd left no detail unexamined.
Of the low-cost models, none passed the Sarah test. Too scratchy, too small, poorly made, too difficult to set up. She found one she did love – but it came with a nearly $100 price tag.
They had a mission for their new Amazon ecommerce business: Make the greatest hammock anyone ever owned at half the price.
When she was dreaming up the Wise Owl brand, Sarah created a script for a video ad. In her storyboards, she would proffer a Wise Owl hammock toward the camera and explain to viewers that what she was holding in her hand was not in fact a hammock at all… but happiness. Wise Owl was selling the feeling she had in childhood, what she wanted everyone to experience themselves.
In 2015, Sarah and Todd drew down their savings to place her first purchase order of 200 hammocks. The day the products arrived on her doorstep was another lesson in the challenges of building an Amazon ecommerce business. She opened the box and … the Wise Owl logo was the wrong color. Even worse, the hammocks were stuffed into long and skinny carrying sacks. “They were basically two-foot-long sausages,” she says. She pulled them all apart and paid a local seamstress to fix every logo patch and every sack.
Today, Wise Owl is a booming online Amazon ecommerce business. The hammocks are nearing 40,000 ratings and maintain an impressive average of 4.8. Wise Owl has earned dual Best Seller Badges in both the camping hammocks and patio hammocks categories, while its camping pillows and hammock bug net also have Best Seller Badges. In 2021 alone, the brand sold hundreds of thousands of units in its product line. At the end of 2021, the Camping Hammock was capturing the majority of the market share for camping hammocks on Amazon.
hammocks will launch in the Canadian, UK, and German Amazon markets – a huge expansion for what started as a small Amazon ecommerce business.

------------------------
Every company has growing pains. To maintain a healthy outlook for your brand's future, don't overlook these key action items.
To strengthen the health of your FBA brand, it can pay to look beyond the bottom line. Have you grown a solid base of happy repeat customers? Or earned an avalanche of 5-star Amazon reviews for your products?  These are the kind of success markers that don’t directly appear on a profit and loss statement — but they can translate into higher customer lifetime value and a stronger FBA brand. In other words, to build an FBA brand with staying power, it helps to consider the big picture of your business.
Here are 4 strategies to think about.
If you’re used to thinking only about profit margin, you may want to start thinking about profit-dollars as well. Your goal should be to improve conversion rates and sales velocity on the products that provide the most bang for the buck in profit-dollars.
Conversion share is the number of times customers bought your product after searching with a given keyword, divided by the total number of times customers bought any product after searching with that same keyword. You want this number to grow over time. It shows you’re capturing a bigger slice of the pie linked to keywords associated with your product.
. The report is a gold mine of insights about your category and your FBA business.
to see which images perform best.
And yes, go for the video. A lot of people don’t incorporate video because it seems too hard or complex. Think of this: we’ve made very professional marketing videos with celebrities that have cost tens of thousands of dollars – and in some scenarios, those convert less than something made in 20 minutes on an iPhone. The lesson? It doesn’t have to be an insane production to be successful. It just needs to connect with customers.
Reviews are the lifeblood of an Amazon ecommerce business. You know this. When faced with an array of similar products, customers often default to the one with the most positive reviews. High-quality reviews start with a high-quality product, of course, but after that, you’ll need to do a little more work to earn your stars.
The work is well worth it. You want to create a moat of positive reviews around your products – an unbridgeable gap between your well-loved products and those of your closest competitors. And to increase your volume of positive reviews, you’ll need to increase your volume of sales. This may mean selling at a loss via a temporary price cut, running Amazon Deals, or increasing ad spending to boost traffic.

Lifelong Online’s co-founders built a powerhouse brand that put a dent in India’s appliance market. The secret to their success? Listen to who matters most – the customer.
market for ecommerce businesses. To be successful, brands must navigate the complexities of India’s delivery infrastructure. They also need to understand the diverse needs of Indian customers, what they want, how they shop, and what they value. In a country of 1.4 billion people, that is extraordinarily difficult.
Which is why the team charged with leading Thrasio’s foray into India are people who know what it takes to build a successful ecommerce brand there.
“It’s our customers, their stories, and their experiences with our products that really inspire me,” says Bharat Kalia, one the three co-founders and CEO of Lifelong Online (now called Lifelong, a Thrasio Company).
Kalia founded Lifelong in 2015 with two partners – Atul Raheja and Varun Grover. Since then, they’ve created more than 100 products, primarily in the kitchen-and-home, and health-and-fitness categories. Air fryers, stoves, stand mixers, treadmills, massagers, hair straighteners: a Lifelong product can be found in about a million homes in more than 500 cities.
The three founders of India-based company Lifelong, a Thrasio company.
But perhaps its biggest triumph is how Lifelong boldly entered the appliance market – a notoriously difficult category dominated by large, entrenched brands. “The products I was using in my home were the same my parents used,” Kalia says.
can be tucked behind a couch or under a bed – the ultimate solution for health-conscious Indians living in space-challenged homes. Today it is one of the best-selling products in the Lifelong line.
Or consider the case of Lifelong’s early version bicycle. Customers were frustrated with how much time and effort it took to put together. “People were saying ‘This is the hardest thing I ever did,’” Kalia says. The next version had just 5 moving parts and came 90% pre-assembled. Now they’re on version 3.
The customer is both king and queen at Lifelong.
A new product launch can involve 2 or 3 interactions with customers in a month, conversations that are coded and analyzed to ensure products are delivering happiness and satisfaction. “We analyze a ton of data and carefully codify our questions before making customer calls,” Kalia says.
This extraordinary openness to feedback goes back to Lifelong’s very first product, an oven toaster griller. In their enthusiasm, Kalia and the founders mounted a product listing before the product was actually ready. “We were super happy to get our first order,” Kalia says. “The problem was we only had a prototype.” He gave the customer a heads-up that the product was a bit of a work in progress – and then packed it up and mailed it across the country to the customer.
in less than prime condition. (“Basically, it was mangled,” Kalia says.) After multiple calls with the customer, Kalia delivered a new model to the customer within 2 weeks. After all that, the customer left Lifelong a positive review.
Lifelong’s employees hard at work building a next generation consumer goods company in India. Thrasio bought a majority share in Lifelong in January.
Lifelong’s goal of reaching every household in a country of 1.4 billion people will require keeping a careful eye on how the market is changing. People aren’t as tied to legacy brands as they once were, Kalia says, and younger generations are more comfortable with ecommerce.

, your gateway to building a better consumer goods company. Every edition, we’ll share stories, insights, and expertise on a topic critical to the industry. This issue: the importance of quality assurance and making sure the products you deliver truly deliver.
Your customers expect the best. Here are 5 steps to build a strong quality assurance program and become more effective at preventing the defective.
Everyone’s been there. You buy a product that you’re excited to use, and then, when you need it, it fails to live up to its claims. Total headache. But for a business owner, one defective item can potentially set off a torrent of torment: a batch that has to be recalled, poor reviews that affect customer acquisition and loyalty, and even additional rounds of production. Fortunately, a strong quality assurance program can save the day, catching defective products before they ever ship to your customers.
If you don’t have a program in place, fear not: Axel Gonzalez has your back. Thrasio’s senior director of quality assurance and sustainability shares 5 steps to get you started.
Take, for example, the premium 10-piece bartender set Thrasio sells through our Mixology & Craft brand. It’s a showpiece with a premium price point. As such, its form can’t have scratches, dirty marks, or any flaws in its shape. Its strainer has to snugly fit inside the shaker so that no liquid leaks, while each piece must also fit in the display stand. And in order to meet Mixology & Craft’s goal of creating delicious cocktails, the shakers need to function as closed vessels that allow you to quickly mix ingredients together while simultaneously chilling the drink. This bartender set needs to bring your dreams of perfect libations to life.
Take some time to think about how form, fit, and function apply to your products. Literally make a list. This is the start of your quality assurance program, how you’ll begin to understand which attributes need to be assessed and tested. Depending on the complexity of your product, it could be a long list. But by clearly identifying what really matters to your products early on, you’ll set yourself up for a smooth operation and strong defense against trouble down the road.
Once you’ve decided what you’re going to test for, you need a resource to guide you through the process. Enter the quality acceptance document.
“The quality acceptance document is essentially the playbook that you will use to carry out your product inspections,” Gonzalez notes.
Picture a playbook for an NFL team. At its most basic, you’ll have your coaching staff and players (or, who’s leading and conducting the testing process), your schedule (how often you test), and your gameplan (how you’ll conduct tests). Instead of using Xs and Os and other visual aids to run your plays, however, you’ll use pictures that help you tell which products will pass a quality check, which will fail, and why. The playbook will also outline the sample sizes you’ll test and define what percentage of defective products will signal the need to reject a whole batch.
Use your written explanation of ideal form, fit, and function to identify what imperfections to test for. These will fall into 1 of 3 categories: minor defect, major defect, or critical defect. For example, a scratch on a cocktail shaker might be considered a minor defect, while a warped shaker that doesn’t fit inside the other shaker could be deemed a critical defect. The amount of defects you find in your sample size will give you an idea about whether you can ship your products, need to do additional testing, or have to – sigh – reject the batch outright.
You can then come up with your own sample sizes and rejection thresholds, but the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) also has a standardized acceptance quality limit (AQL) sampling system for inspection by attributes. The AQL chart can be used to provide information and guidance on inspection levels, rejection thresholds, and sample sizes for individual shipments.
If this seems like a lot, it doesn’t have to be. You don’t want to go it alone when creating a quality acceptance document. Incorporate your supplier into the process.
“It only makes sense that your supplier agrees to everything in the document so that both parties are on the same page in terms of what is and is not acceptable,” Gonzalez says.
By having quality standards clearly laid out and agreed upon ahead of time, you reduce the risk of having a drawn-out dispute with your supplier over an unsatisfactory batch of product.
Striking the right balance on quality assurance can also be tricky. You have to take a bit of a Goldilocks approach with it. Too strict and you run the risk of rejecting too much product, which can lead to delays and stockouts. Too lax and defective products can end up making their way to customers, paving the way for negative reviews. Knowing early on what is realistic for your supplier to achieve from a quality standpoint can save you a lot of time and money down the road.
Oh … and if you’ve never built a quality acceptance document before, no problem.
Templates to help structure your document are available online.
Gonzalez strongly advises against relying on your manufacturer to carry out product inspections on your behalf. “You want an impartial inspector,” he says. “You need to insist on it. Otherwise, you can be left with a supplier who cuts corners when it comes to quality assurance in the hopes of avoiding rejects.” But, Gonzalez adds, there are a few things to keep in mind when looking for a solid third-party inspection company to partner with.
Third-party inspection companies need to be available on short notice. Our partner promises to have an agent on site and ready to conduct an inspection, anywhere in continental Asia, within 24 hours. This kind of flexibility is invaluable, as it minimizes delays across our vast network of suppliers. But even if you only have a few suppliers, if the past 2 years have taught us anything, it’s that unexpected delays and last-minute changes are a fact of life. Knowing that your third-party inspection company has the flexibility to swiftly react to these changes is a huge value-add.
Find an inspection company with top-notch technology platforms that allow you to quickly and easily access all of your inspection reports across your suppliers in real time. That’s especially helpful if you’ve got a lot of suppliers (and thus a lot of inspection reports).
Your third-party inspection company should be aligned with the material in your quality acceptance document. After all, they’ll be the ones carrying out the inspections. In their reports, data should be presented clearly and succinctly, allowing you to make quick, informed decisions on which products are ready to ship. A good inspection report will begin with a summary of the main findings, followed by detailed information to support those assessments. When vetting third-party inspection companies, it’s not a bad idea to ask them for sample reports to get a feel for how they present data.
Schedule inspections as soon as your products come off the line – the sooner the better. Why? That gives you time to course correct if there’s a problem. You don’t want to be caught with insufficient inventory because of extended retesting time frames or full-batch rejections.
There’s no “one size fits all” approach to quality assurance. Every product is unique. Even 2 sellers who sell a similar product may have different ideas about what quality testing should look like. And that’s OK. You’re taking steps that give your products the best chance to arrive on the doorsteps of your customers – exactly how they expect them to be.

Im Rahmen unserer Initiative zur Nachhaltigkeit in der Lieferkette haben wir den Standard des Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol übernommen, um unsere Treibhausgasemissionen zu messen, zu verwalten und zu melden. Darüber hinaus haben wir uns mit Pathzero zusammengetan, um die GHG-Emissionen von Port-to-Port-Frachtgeschäften anhand der im Protokoll festgelegten Best Practices einzuschätzen.
Um die Gemeinschaften, in denen wir leben und arbeiten, zu stärken, haben wir bedeutsame, unterhaltsame und wirkungsvolle Mentoring- und philanthropische Möglichkeiten geschaffen.
Das Stipendium von Thrasio in Zusammenarbeit mit der Success Academy (SA) in Harlem bietet High-School-Schülern die Möglichkeit, von unseren Mitarbeitern zu lernen, wie man ein soziales Unternehmen von Grund auf recherchiert, aufbaut und erweitert. Stipendiaten arbeiten in Teams und werden nach mehreren Workshops mit Seed-Finanzierung belohnt, um in ihren Communitys mindestens ein akzeptables Produkt oder eine tragbare Dienstleistung zu starten. So wie Amazon es für kleine und mittlere Unternehmen (KMU) getan hat, hoffen wir auch, das Unternehmertum weiter zu demokratisieren, indem wir Studenten frühzeitig dazu inspirieren, ihr Potenzial als Unternehmer der Zukunft zu erkunden.
Mentorin bei BUILD zu sein, war eine sehr beeindruckende und aufschlussreiche Erfahrung. Es ist unglaublich zu sehen, mit welcher Leidenschaft ein Konzept in ein Produkt umgesetzt wird, auf das die Schüler stolz sind. Die Arbeit bei Thrasio gibt mir das Selbstvertrauen, diesen Studenten zu sagen, dass es eine Welt gibt, die ihren Unternehmergeist schätzt und ihre Lösungsfähigkeiten braucht.
Die Möglichkeit, meiner eigenen Mittelschule etwas zurückzugeben, war eine unglaubliche berufliche Leistung, die auch für mich persönlich sehr wichtig ist. Ich bin begeistert, dass ich in den Gemeinden, in denen ich aufgewachsen bin, etwas bewirken kann, und dass ich klugen jungen Köpfen neue Karrieremöglichkeiten eröffnen kann.
Wir ermutigen die Thrasher, unsere Politik der unbegrenzten bezahlten Freistellung zu nutzen und sich für die Themen einzusetzen, die ihnen am wichtigsten sind.
Machen Sie sich mit einer Gruppe positiver Menschen auf, die Zukunft zu gestalten.

Our leadership team is made up of Amazon veterans, e-commerce connoisseurs and successful entrepreneurs who are at the forefront of rethinking the way products are brought to the world.
Wer wagt, gewinnt. Josh Silberstein und Carlos Cashman verkörpern dieses Motto. Die beiden Thrasio Gründer trafen sich bei der Arbeit an einer Kampagne für die Schmuckmarke Bravelets von Stephanie Fox, die heute COO bei Thrasio ist. Trotz anfänglichen Erfolgen konnte die Marke aufgrund von externen Faktoren und mangelnden Ressourcen jedoch nie ihr volles Potenzial entfalten. Das brachte das Team auf eine Idee: Könnte man angeschlagene E-Commerce-Shops aufkaufen und diese mit Hilfe von skalierbaren Prozessen in die nächste Liga befördern? Gemeinsam wagten sie sich auf ein völlig neues Terrain vor. Dabei haben sie nicht nur den Amazon-Markt für Dritt-Anbieter aufgemischt, sondern eine komplett neue Branche geschaffen, deren Erfolg hunderte von Wettbewerbern hervorgebracht hat.

We take pride in our ability to level up the ecommerce brands we acquire. Check out these case studies to see how unique companies all experienced incredible growth, incredibly fast.
We took a commercial-grade product and made it consumer ready, increasing revenue from $2.5 million to $16.5 million. In the process, this brand became so beloved, it expanded beyond Amazon to be sold in retail stores across the country.
Becky Cameron Home went from one successful product to a cohesive brand through expansive creative updates and pay-per-click (PPC) marketing initiatives for every single product. We increased the brand's Best Seller Rank by 95% in less than three weeks.
Thrasio grew Crafts 4 All over 3X in just 2 years with vibrant packaging, heavily invested PPC, and an expanded product line. Our secret to maintaining its #1 rank? Never run out of inventory.
ThisWorx was initially a small brand led by one successful product. Thrasio improved SEO, updated the photos and videos, and gave a hefty marketing push to make this brand a runaway success in only a few months. Our best-in-class brand management is slated to 5X ThisWorx revenue in 2021.
Thrasio revamped PPC, launched generous customer service initiatives, and brought TrailBuddy into new marketplaces—making this brand a global success.
Our case studies are for general information purposes; they are not guarantees of future performance and undue reliance should not be placed on them. Each study is based on a particular set of facts and conditions at a point in time and may involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. The performance, financial results, and projections for the products or sellers in these case studies may not be parallel in others.

------------------------
Der durchschnittliche monatliche Pay-per-Click-Umsatz stieg von 2019 bis Oktober 2021 um 1860 %.
Angry Orange, ein Spray zur Beseitigung von Haustiergerüchen, war eine 4 Jahre alte Marke, die jährlich einen Umsatz von über 2 Millionen US-Dollar generierte, als der Gründer Adam St. George beschloss, sich aus dem Amazon FBA-Geschäft zurückzuziehen. Innerhalb einer Woche nach dem Treffen mit dem Team von Thrasio war das Geschäft abgeschlossen.
Dieses kommerzielle Produkt war ein durchschlagender Erfolg, aber die Marke musste verbrauchertauglich gemacht werden. Der einzige logische Schritt war ein umfassendes Rebranding der gesamten Angry Orange-Produktlinie.
Um das Produkt verbrauchertauglich zu machen, haben wir die Verpackung komplett überarbeitet. Ein umfassendes Rebranding der Produktlinie Angry Orange erzählte eine Geschichte, die auch das Vertrauen der Verbraucher stärkte.
Diese Verbesserungen führen zu wirkungsvollen Optimierungen von Listings und betonen die Geschichte und den Wert der Marke in den Texten der Listings, Bildern und Videos sowie A+-Inhalten.
Das Marketingteam von Thrasio trieb das Wachstum sowohl durch Platzierungen auf Amazon als auch durch Traffic-erzeugende Kanäle außerhalb von Amazon wie Facebook und Google voran. Angesichts des großen Verbraucherinteresses war klar, dass Angry Orange das Zeug dazu hatte, auch in den DTC-Kanälen zu wachsen und seit März 2020 21 % zum Gesamtumsatz beizutragen. Die Marketinginitiativen von Thrasio umfassten auch Influencer-Marketingvereinbarungen, die sich weiterentwickelt haben, um Promi-Empfehlungen einzubeziehen.
Das ursprüngliche 8oz Angry Orange Konzentrat war ein Vorzeigeprodukt, das einen treuen Kultstatus genoss. Thrasio hat die Produktinnovation durch die Entwicklung einer gebrauchsfertigen Version des Konzentrats in verschiedenen Größen, einschließlich eines Gallonenkrugs, auf ein neues Niveau gebracht. Wir haben die Produktreihe um ein sofort einsatzfähiges Spray erweitert, um Flecken zu entfernen, und Anfang 2020 wurde ein Badezimmerspray eingeführt.
Angry Orange hat seitdem ein stetiges Wachstum auf Amazon erlebt. Dank unseres Großhandelsteams können Verbraucher es auch in den Einzelhandelsregalen finden. Wählen Sie Target-, Walmart-, Ace Hardware- und True Value-Geschäfte, um Angry Orange jetzt an Käufer in den USA zu verkaufen.

https://www.thrasio.com/de/for-sellers/case-studies/becky-cameron
------------------------
Als Thrasio Becky Cameron Home übernahm, war das Hauptprodukt des Unternehmens in der Kategorie Kissen auf Amazon gut platziert und hatte 12.000 Bewertungen. Wir bauten diese Position aus, indem wir kreative Updates anwandten und Marketinginitiativen von Grund auf neu aufbauten. Dies erhöhte die Verkaufsgeschwindigkeit und gab den Startschuss für eine neue Bestandsprognose – alles Teil einer umfassenden Strategie zum Wachstum der Marke.
Mit über 2.500 Amazon Standard Identification Numbers (ASINs) war Becky Cameron Home unsere bisher größte Markengewinnung. Unser erster Auftrag bestand darin, die Produktlinie zu konsolidieren, um die Vertriebsgeschwindigkeit zu steigern. Wir wussten auch, dass wir durch die Stärkung der Lieferkette drastische Kosteneinsparungen erzielen konnten.
Jeder Thrasher hat einen Beitrag zum Erfolg dieser Marke geleistet, indem er jeden Eintrag durchkämmte, um kreative SEO-Titel-Tags zu aktualisieren und sicherzustellen, dass jeder Eintrag Amazon TOS konform war. Außerdem haben wir zwei neue Lieferanten hinzugefügt und die Fertigungskapazität um das Fünffache erhöht. Wir haben dann Datensatz-Tools entwickelt, die uns helfen, eine Marke dieser Größe und größer zu verwalten.
Als wir BCH erwarben, hatte das 2er-Pack Gel Queen-Kissenset die zweithöchste Anzahl von Bewertungen in der Kategorie auf Amazon. Wir haben die Werbeausgaben deutlich erhöht und den Eintrag von SEO bis hin zum kreativen Branding optimiert. Unsere Bemühungen haben sich ausgezahlt.
Viele ASINs dieser Marke hatten keinen vollständigen Eintrag, was sich negativ auf die Suchmaschinenoptimierung auswirkte. Für jeden Eintrag haben wir das Branding mit einem neuen luxuriösen Look aktualisiert und 9 Eintragsfotos und A+-Inhalte hinzugefügt, um das Vertrauen zu stärken.
Eine solide Marketingstrategie für diese Marke bot eine große Chance, das Wachstum zu fördern. PPC war ein großer Teil dieses Ansatzes, neben anderen Maßnahmen wie Amazon-Events (z. B. Amazon Live), Affiliate-Marketing, Social Media und DTC.

------------------------
Steigerung des EBITDA um 148% innerhalb von 2 Jahren nach Übernahme.
Umsatzsteigerung um ca. 90% innerhalb von 2 Jahren nach Übernahme.
Als wir Crafts 4 All gekauft haben, war das Heldenprodukt bereits die Nummer 1 in seiner Kategorie auf Amazon. Thrasio baute diese Position aus, indem es die Kreativität der Marke verbesserte, stark in Pay-per-Click-Marketing investierte und die Produktpalette erweiterte. Unser Supply-Chain-Team sorgte außerdem dafür, dass der Marke nie die Bestände ausgingen – keine Kleinigkeit angesichts der durch COVID-19 verursachten Nachfrage.
Crafts 4 All stellte eine klassische Herausforderung für Angebot und Nachfrage dar, aber COVID-19 war die eigentliche Hürde, die es zu überwinden galt. Wir tauchten tief in den Fertigungsprozess ein und fanden schnell heraus, dass wir die Lieferkette der Marke stärken müssten, um sicherzustellen, dass wir weiterhin Produkte herstellen können, unabhängig davon, welche Unterbrechung als Nächstes eintritt.
Wir haben die Daten und Erkenntnisse aus der frühen COVID-19-Lieferkettenknappheit in unsere Prognosen für die Weihnachtssaison 2020 einfließen lassen. Wir konnten im 4. Quartal 2021 frei verkaufen und trieben verstärkt Angebote und PPC, um eine nachhaltige Umsatzsteigerung im Jahr 2021 zu haben.
Wir haben unsere Top-Produkte so verpackt, dass sie in eine Nischenunterkategorie passen, was es einfacher macht, den Spitzenplatz zu halten.
Was sollen wir sagen? Wir sind gerne die Nummer 1.
Wir haben eine zusätzliche Variante des Heldenprodukts eingeführt. Drei Kits in verschiedenen Größen zu drei verschiedenen Preispunkten in einem etablierten Listing trieben den Umsatz mit minimalen Auswirkungen auf den Tagesbetrieb voran.
Unser aktualisiertes Branding brachte Farbe in die Verpackung (und damit auch in die Angebotsfotos). Die Produkte heben sich nicht nur in den Suchergebnissen ab, sondern machen das Kit auch zu einem besseren Geschenkartikel. Unsere Farbsätze waren eines der leistungsstärksten Produkte im 4. Quartal 2020.

------------------------
Erhöhung des ThisWorx Best Sellers Rank (BSR) um 98 %.
Der Eigentümer von ThisWorx gründete eine kleine Marke, die sich auf ein beliebtes Produkt stützte – einen Handstaubsauger für Autos, der bei den Kunden sehr beliebt war. Thrasio baute auf diesem Erfolg auf, indem er die Suchmaschinenoptimierungsstrategien der Marke verbessert, professionelle Fotos und Videos hinzufügt und in einen hochkarätigen Marketing-Push investiert. Das Ergebnis? Die Marke wurde in nur wenigen Monaten zu einem durchschlagenden Erfolg.
Als wir ThisWorx erworben haben, lieferten wir uns ein Kopf-an-Kopf-Rennen mit einer anderen Marke, die ein sehr ähnliches Produkt anbot. Thrasio musste den Wettbewerbsvorteil unseres Autostaubsaugers ermitteln.
ThisWorx Deal of the Day (DOTD) stellte sich als der erste 1 Mio. $-Tag der Marke heraus. Seit diesem ersten Geschäft haben wir eine Strategie entwickelt, die so viele DOTDs wie möglich durchführt und dazwischen andere Angebot einfügt. Bis heute hatte ThisWorx sechs Tage mit mehr als 1 Mio. $ und hat allein mit Geschäften über 20 Mio. $ verdient.
Wir haben den Preis unseres Staubsaugers um 17 % (von 29,97 $ auf 34,99 $) erhöht, um unsere Geschäftsstrategie möglich zu machen und den Umsatz zu steigern. Außerdem signalisiert es Käufern, dass ThisWorx-Produkte mit höherer Qualität und Langlebigkeit als die Produkte unserer Wettbewerber entwickelt wurden.
ThisWorx hat am Prime Day 2020 mehr Staubsauger verkauft als das gesamte Portfolio von Thrasio. Wir verzeichneten am Prime Day einen Zuwachs von 405 % im Vergleich zum Vorjahr und haben seit der Übernahme nun 47 Mal mehr Bewertungen.
Unsere Umgestaltung des ThisWorx-Brandings umfasste professionelle Fotografie, eine verbesserte Verpackung und strategische Texte – und bewies damit, dass ThisWorx die bessere Wahl ist. Seitdem haben wir die Konkurrenz hinter uns gelassen.

https://www.thrasio.com/de/for-sellers/case-studies/trailbuddy
------------------------
Als Thrasio TrailBuddy — eine Outdoor-Marke mit zwei separaten Shops — erwarb, hatte das Unternehmen bereits einen soliden Ruf für die Herstellung qualitativ hochwertiger Produkte. Sowohl seine Laufstangen als auch seine Schulternetzprodukte hielten die besten Seller Badges und hatten starke Best Seller Ratings in der Kategorie Sport & Outdoor von Amazon. Wir sahen sofort Möglichkeiten, die starke Position von TrailBuddy auszubauen.
TrailBuddy war bereits eine gesunde Marke, so dass der beste Weg für Wachstum darin bestand, die Sichtbarkeit bei den Käufern zu erhöhen. Thrasio hat die PPC Kampagnen überarbeitet, großzügige Kundenservicemaßnahmen initiiert und TrailBuddy auf neue Märkte und Onlinekanäle ausgeweitet.
Nach den Erfolgen in den USA führte das internationale Team von Thrasio die TrailBuddy-Trekkingstöcke in Kanada und Großbritannien ein. Das Wachstum war explosiv. In Kanada erreichte TrailBuddy in weniger als zwei Wochen die Nummer 1 der Bestsellerliste. Am dritten Tag auf dem britischen Markt erreichten die TrailBuddy-Trekkingstöcke Platz 2 der Suchergebnisse.
Wir haben die 4,7-Sterne-Bewertung mit großzügigen Kundenservice-Initiativen gesichert, die über die Kundenerwartungen hinausgehen. Heute hat unser kundenbesessenes Team eine durchschnittliche Reaktionszeit von etwa 2 Stunden. Außerdem verfolgen wir die Vorschläge von Trendkunden für Produktverbesserungen und geben dieses Feedback sofort an das Markenmanagement weiter, um in Zukunft noch bessere Produkte zu entwickeln.
Wir haben jede Werbemöglichkeit mit dieser Marke genutzt, die Amazon bietet. Im ersten Jahr, in dem wir das Unternehmen besaßen, investierten wir einen 6-stelligen Betrag in PPC, um das Volumen zu erhöhen.
Unser Modell ermöglicht es uns, frühzeitig strategische Investitionen zu tätigen, die zu langfristigen Gewinnen für unsere Marken führen.
Nachdem wir die Qualität und Langlebigkeit der Produkte unserer Wettbewerber getestet hatten, waren wir zuversichtlich, dass TrailBuddy eine hochwertige Marke war. So konnten wir mit neuen Vertriebs- und Marketingstrategien experimentieren, ohne das Risiko einzugehen, dass die Bewertungen und Rezensionen verloren gehen.
Die Daten und Erkenntnisse, die wir aus dieser Test- und Lernphase gewonnen haben, fließen nun in die Wachstumsstrategien für andere Marken in unserem Portfolio ein.

As Thrasio expands across the world, we are committed to growing our global consciousness even faster. Our impact on the environment and the opportunity to lift people up help guide every decision we make.
Through our Responsible Sourcing Program, we partner with amfori, the leading global business association for open and sustainable trade, to implement tools and best practices that evaluate the social performance of our supply chain. Suppliers are committed to follow the amfori code of conduct – 11 principles ranging from fair payments to environmental protection.
As part of our Supply Chain Sustainability initiative, we’ve adopted the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol standard to measure, manage, and report our GHG emissions. We've also partnered with Pathzero to estimate GHG emissions from port-to-port freight operations, following best practices as specified in the Protocol.
To strengthen the communities in which we live and work, we’ve created meaningful, fun, and high-engagement mentorship and philanthropic opportunities.
Thrasio’s fellowship in collaboration with Success Academy (SA) in Harlem offers high school students the opportunity to learn from our employees how to research, build, and scale a social enterprise from scratch. Fellows work in teams and, after a series of workshops, are awarded seed funding to launch a minimum viable product or service in their communities. As Amazon has done for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), we also hope to further democratize entrepreneurship by inspiring students early on to explore their potential as the entrepreneurs of the future.
Being a mentor at BUILD has been a very humbling and eye-opening experience. It is incredible to see the passion that goes into developing a concept into a product that the students are proud of. Working at Thrasio gives me the confidence to tell these students that there is a world that values their entrepreneurial spirits and needs their problem-solving skills.
Being able to give back to my own middle school was an incredible professional accomplishment that’s also very important to me personally. I’m thrilled to be able to impact the communities where I grew up and to potentially introduce new career possibilities for bright young minds.
We encourage Thrashers to utilize our unlimited paid time off policy and take action on issues that are most meaningful to them.
Take off with a group of positive people out to define the future.

Some say fortune favors the brave. Josh and Carlos’ good fortune started when they met while working on a purpose-driven jewelry brand called Bravelets, founded by current Thrasio COO Stephanie Fox. Though the company was initially successful, environmental factors and a lack of resources kept it from growing to its maximum potential. This gave them an idea: What if they could roll up struggling ecommerce companies into one portfolio and use a single set of operators and scalable processes to take them to the next level? Talk about entering a brave new world. Together, they disrupted the 3P marketplace on Amazon and established a category that has gone on to inspire hundreds of competitors.

At Thrasio, we’re reimagining how to make the world’s most-loved products accessible to everyone. So we work with successful sellers, using a deep understanding of rankings, ratings, and reviews – plus supply chain and marketing smarts – to transform the art and science of commerce.

I love how quickly Thrasio can move, how fair they are with their valuation, and how well they aligned with our vision. I returned to Thrasio to sell my second and third businesses.

------------------------
Seller achieved 100% of his earnout.
Average monthly PPC sales increased 1,860%.
Increased revenue 11X to $23.1 million.
Angry Orange, a pet-odor eliminator, was a 4-year-old brand generating more than $2 million in annual revenue when Adam St. George decided to exit the Amazon FBA game. Within a week of introductions with Thrasio, the deal was done.
This commercial-grade product was a smashing success, but the brand needed to become consumer-ready. The only logical move was a comprehensive rebrand of the entire Angry Orange product line.
To make the product consumer-ready, we completely revamped the packaging. A comprehensive rebrand of the Angry Orange product line told a story that also built consumer trust.
These improvements lent themselves to impactful listing optimizations, emphasizing the brand story and value within listing copy, imagery and video, and A+ content.
Thrasio’s marketing team drove growth from both on-Amazon placements as well as off-Amazon, traffic-generating channels like Facebook and Google. With its high level of consumer interest, it was clear Angry Orange had the chops to grow into DTC channels as well, contributing 21% of total sales since March 2020. Thrasio’s marketing initiatives also included influencer marketing agreements, which have evolved to include celebrity endorsements.
The original 8oz Angry Orange concentrate was a hero product that earned a loyal cult following. Thrasio took product innovation to a new level by creating a ready-to-use version of the concentrate in multiple sizes, including a gallon jug. We expanded the product line to include a ready-to-use spray for stain removal and introduced a bathroom spray in early 2020.
Angry Orange has since experienced steady growth on Amazon. Thanks to our wholesale team, consumers also can find it on retail shelves. Select Target, Walmart, Ace Hardware, and True Value stores now sell Angry Orange to shoppers across the United States.

95% BSR improvement in less than 3 weeks.
Increased EBITDA ~169% since acquisition.
Increased hero ASIN sales ~487% since acquisition.
When Thrasio acquired Becky Cameron Home (BCH), the company’s hero product was already well ranked with the second-highest number of reviews in the pillow category. We leveraged this solid positioning by applying creative updates and rebuilding pay-per-click (PPC) initiatives from the ground up. This effectively accelerated sales velocity and triggered an inventory re-forecast – requiring a flexible and streamlined brand operations strategy.
With over 2,500 ASINs, BCH was the largest brand acquisition to date. We consolidated ASINs and focused on top listings, while driving dramatic cost savings by tightening up the supply chain and scaling our manufacturing capacity.
Every Thrasher had a hand in this brand's success — combing through each listing to update creative, SEO title tags, and ensure each listing was Amazon TOS compliant. We also added two two new suppliers and increased manufacturing capacity by 5X. We then built data set tools to help us manage a brand of this size and larger.
When we acquired BCH, the 2-Pack Gel Queen Pillow Set had the second-highest number of reviews in the category on Amazon. We significantly increased ad spend and optimized the listing from SEO to creative branding. Our effort paid off in a big way.
Many ASINs in this brand did not have a complete listing, which negatively affected SEO. For each listing, we updated branding with a new luxe feel and added 9 listing photos and A+ content to increase trust.
A robust marketing strategy for this brand held a big opportunity to help drive growth. PPC was a huge part of that approach, with other efforts including Amazon events (e.g. Amazon Live), affiliate marketing, social media, and DTC.

The performance, financial results, and projections for the products or sellers in these case studies may not be parallel in others.
We took a commercial-grade product and made it consumer ready, increasing revenue from $2.5 million to $16.5 million. In the process, this brand became so beloved, it expanded beyond Amazon to be sold in retail stores across the country.
Thrasio revamped PPC, launched generous customer service initiatives, and brought TrailBuddy into new marketplaces—making this brand a global success.

------------------------
Ranks #1 in several subcategories as a top crafting competitor.
Increased EBITDA by ~239% within 2 years of acquisition.
Increased revenue by ~152% within 2 years of acquisition.
When we purchased Crafts 4 All, the hero ASIN was already #1 in its category. Thrasio applied creative updates, invested heavily in PPC, expanded the product line, and worked aggressively to maintain the #1 rank by committing to the goal of never running out of inventory. The COVID-19 sales spike in the category put our products in high demand. We were able to maintain inventory and increase sales velocity as other sellers stocked out.
We dug deep into the manufacturing process involved in making the product and found that without making key supply chain improvements, Crafts 4 All inventory would always be unstable.
We leveraged the data and learnings from early COVID-19 supply chain scarcity into our forecasting for the 2020 holiday season. No longer constrained by on-hand inventory, we were able to sell freely in Q4 — pushing promotions and PPC even harder for a sustained increase in sales continuing into 2021.
We packaged our top products to fit into a niche subcategory, which made it easier to consistently maintain top rank.
What can we say? We like being #1.
We launched an additional variation to the hero product. Offering three different sized kits at three different price points within an established listing drove sales with minimal impact on day-to-day operations.
Our updated branding added color to the packaging (and therefore the listing photos). Not only did the products stand out in the search results, they also made the kit a more giftable item. Our paint sets were one of the top-performing products in Q4 2020.

https://www.thrasio.com/uk/for-sellers/case-studies/thisworx
------------------------
The founder made 100% of his earnout in 2021.
Average daily sales have increased by 8X.
Increased revenue ~785% since acquisition.
The owner of ThisWorx founded a small brand led by one successful product. Thrasio applied new SEO title tags, creative content, and a hefty marketing push to quickly elevate the brand. Expert brand management and pay-per-click (PPC) initiatives made this brand a runaway success within the first few months post-acquisition. After increasing the ThisWorx Best Seller Rank by 98% in just three weeks, the brand's hero products are now #1 and #2 in certain car-related categories.
When we first acquired ThisWorx, we were neck-and-neck with another brand offering a very similar product. Thrasio needed to identify the competitive edge to our car vacuum.
ThisWorx Deal of the Day (DOTD) turned out to be the brand's first $1M day. Since that first deal, we've built a strategy of running as many DOTDs as possible, supplementing with lightning deals in between. To date, ThisWorx has had six $1M+ days, and made over $20M on deals alone.
We increased our vacuum’s price by 17% (from $29.97 to $34.99) to make running our deal strategy possible and drive sales. It also signaled to shoppers that ThisWorx products are built with more quality and longevity than our competitors' products.
ThisWorx sold more vacuums on Prime Day in 2020 than Thrasio's whole portfolio. We experienced 405% year-over-year increase on Prime Day and now have 47X more reviews since acquisition.
Our ThisWorx branding refresh included professional photography, upgraded packaging, and strategic copy – proving ThisWorx as the higher quality choice. We've blown past the competition ever since.

https://www.thrasio.com/uk/for-sellers/case-studies/trailbuddy
------------------------
Increased EBITDA ~300%.
Increased reviews by 1,100%.
When Thrasio acquired TrailBuddy — an outdoor brand with two separate storefronts — the company already had a solid reputation for making top-quality products. Both its Trekking Poles and Boulder Net products held Best Seller Badges and had strong Best Seller Ratings in the Sports & Outdoor category. We immediately saw opportunities to build on established TrailBuddy success.
TrailBuddy was already a healthy brand, so the best path forward for growth was expansion into new marketplaces like the UK, Canada, Germany, and Japan.
After wins in the U.S., Thrasio’s International Team launched TrailBuddy trekking poles in Canada and the UK. The growth was explosive. In Canada, TrailBuddy reached the #1 Best Seller Rating in under two weeks. On the third day in the UK market, TrailBuddy trekking poles reached #2 in search results.
We safeguarded the 4.7-star rating with generous customer service initiatives that go above and beyond customer expectations. Today, our customer obsession team has an average response time of about 2 hours. We also track trending customer suggestions for product improvements and immediately share that feedback with brand management to develop even stronger products in the future.
We took every advertisement opportunity Amazon offers with this brand. In the first year we owned the business, we made a 6-figure investment in PPC to build volume.
Our model allows us to make early strategic investments that lead to long-term gains for our brands.
After testing the quality and durability of our competitors’ products, we were confident TrailBuddy was a high-quality brand. That allowed us to experiment with new distribution and marketing strategies without the risk of sacrificing ratings and reviews. The data and insights we gained from that test-and-learn period now inform growth strategies for other brands in our portfolio.

When Thrasio acquired Becky Cameron Home, the company’s hero product was well-ranked in the pillow category on Amazon and boasted 12,000 reviews. We built on this position by applying creative updates and rebuilding marketing initiatives from the ground up. This increased sales and a new inventory forecast – all part of a comprehensive brand strategy.
With more than 2,500 Amazon Standard Identification Numbers (ASINs), Becky Cameron Home was our largest brand acquisition to date. Our first order of business was to consolidate the product line to help drive sales velocity. We also knew we could save dramatically on costs by shoring up the supply chain.
Every Thrasher had a hand in this brand's success — combing through each listing to update creative, SEO title tags, and ensure each listing was Amazon TOS compliant. We also added two new suppliers and increased manufacturing capacity by 5X. We then built data set tools to help us manage a brand of this size and larger.
When we acquired Becky Cameron Home, the 2-Pack Gel Queen Pillow Set had the second-highest number of reviews in the category on Amazon. We significantly increased ad spend and optimized the listing from SEO to creative branding.
Many ASINs in this brand did not have a complete listing, which negatively affected SEO. For each listing, we updated branding with a new luxe feel and added 9 listing photos and A+ content to increase trust.
A robust marketing strategy for this brand held a big opportunity to help drive growth. Pay-per-click advertising was a huge part of that approach, with other efforts including Amazon events (e.g. Amazon Live), affiliate marketing, social media, and DTC.

Cloud Massage had been selling successfully on Amazon for over a year when Thrasio bought the brand. The hero product's unique appeal? Users can enjoy the foot-and-calf massager while sitting up, reclining, or lying down — whatever position they find most comfortable. We built on that success with an all-out marketing strategy to grow the brand.
In order to scale Cloud Massage, we increased inventory and more than doubled manufacturing capacity. We also kicked our growth strategy into high gear utilizing a mix of coupons, Amazon Deals, celebrity endorsements, and pay-per-click advertising efforts.
We started offering coupons for Cloud Massage right away. The strategy worked. The deep discounts incentivized conversions, and the brand’s sales velocity increased enough to make the product eligible for Amazon Deals. The brand's Best Sellers Rank improved significantly, it nabbed the Best Seller Badge, and then Cloud Massage was off to the races.
New photos, videos, and branding took Cloud Massage from being a well-liked product to a premium, Thrasio-worthy brand. With a fresh new logo, updated color palette, and messaging focusing on the product’s versatility, the brand began climbing the ranks in health and household categories.
Thanks to Thrasio’s Product Strategy & Development team, Cloud Massage will debut a new massage product in 2022. The new version is more technologically advanced, with a new user interface, soft-touch buttons, an auto-stop feature, and a remote control.
Over on the direct-to-consumer (DTC) side, we invested heavily in paid search, paid social, SEO, email campaigns, and affiliate marketing. The investment paid off. Sales on the brand’s site jumped from $100K in annual revenue to over $100K in weekly revenue. In 2021, the brand's DTC sales revenue on Black Friday nearly doubled its DTC earnings on the same day in 2020.

------------------------
Der durchschnittliche monatliche Pay-per-Click-Umsatz stieg von 2019 bis Oktober 2021 um 1860 %.
Angry Orange, ein Spray zur Beseitigung von Haustiergerüchen, war eine 4 Jahre alte Marke, die jährlich einen Umsatz von über 2 Millionen US-Dollar generierte, als der Gründer Adam St. George beschloss, sich aus dem Amazon FBA-Geschäft zurückzuziehen. Innerhalb einer Woche nach dem Treffen mit dem Team von Thrasio war das Geschäft abgeschlossen.
Dieses kommerzielle Produkt war ein durchschlagender Erfolg, aber die Marke musste verbrauchertauglich gemacht werden. Der einzige logische Schritt war ein umfassendes Rebranding der gesamten Angry Orange-Produktlinie.
Um das Produkt verbrauchertauglich zu machen, haben wir die Verpackung komplett überarbeitet. Ein umfassendes Rebranding der Produktlinie Angry Orange erzählte eine Geschichte, die auch das Vertrauen der Verbraucher stärkte.
Diese Verbesserungen führen zu wirkungsvollen Optimierungen von Listings und betonen die Geschichte und den Wert der Marke in den Texten der Listings, Bildern und Videos sowie A+-Inhalten.
Das Marketingteam von Thrasio trieb das Wachstum sowohl durch Platzierungen auf Amazon als auch durch Traffic-erzeugende Kanäle außerhalb von Amazon wie Facebook und Google voran. Angesichts des großen Verbraucherinteresses war klar, dass Angry Orange das Zeug dazu hatte, auch in den DTC-Kanälen zu wachsen und seit März 2020 21 % zum Gesamtumsatz beizutragen. Die Marketinginitiativen von Thrasio umfassten auch Influencer-Marketingvereinbarungen, die sich weiterentwickelt haben, um Promi-Empfehlungen einzubeziehen.
Das ursprüngliche 8oz Angry Orange Konzentrat war ein Vorzeigeprodukt, das einen treuen Kultstatus genoss. Thrasio hat die Produktinnovation durch die Entwicklung einer gebrauchsfertigen Version des Konzentrats in verschiedenen Größen, einschließlich eines Gallonenkrugs, auf ein neues Niveau gebracht. Wir haben die Produktreihe um ein sofort einsatzfähiges Spray erweitert, um Flecken zu entfernen, und Anfang 2020 wurde ein Badezimmerspray eingeführt.
Angry Orange hat seitdem ein stetiges Wachstum auf Amazon erlebt. Dank unseres Großhandelsteams können Verbraucher es auch in den Einzelhandelsregalen finden. Wählen Sie Target-, Walmart-, Ace Hardware- und True Value-Geschäfte, um Angry Orange jetzt an Käufer in den USA zu verkaufen.

Die Leistung, die finanziellen Ergebnisse und die Prognosen für die Produkte oder Verkäufer in diesen Fallstudien sind in anderen möglicherweise nicht vergleichbar.
ThisWorx war ursprünglich eine kleine Marke, die von einem erfolgreichen Produkt angeführt wurde. Thrasio verbesserte die Suchmaschinenoptimierung, aktualisierte die Fotos und Videos und gab einen kräftigen Marketingschub, um dieser Marke in nur wenigen Monaten zu einem durchschlagenden Erfolg zu verhelfen.
Thrasio vergrößerte Crafts 4 All in nur zwei Jahren um das Dreifache mit einer dynamischen Verpackung, starkem PPC und einer erweiterten Produktlinie. Unser Geheimnis für die Aufrechterhaltung des Rankings Nr. 1? Niemals die Bestände ausgehen lassen.

Seller achieved 100% of his earnout.
Average monthly PPC sales increased 1,860%.
Increased revenue 11X to $23.1 million.
Angry Orange, a pet-odor eliminator, was a 4-year-old brand generating more than $2 million in annual revenue when Adam St. George decided to exit the Amazon FBA game. Within a week of introductions with Thrasio, the deal was done.
This commercial-grade product was a smashing success, but the brand needed to become consumer-ready. The only logical move was a comprehensive rebrand of the entire Angry Orange product line.
To make the product consumer-ready, we completely revamped the packaging. A comprehensive rebrand of the Angry Orange product line told a story that also built consumer trust.
These improvements lent themselves to impactful listing optimizations, emphasizing the brand story and value within listing copy, imagery and video, and A+ content.
Thrasio’s marketing team drove growth from both on-Amazon placements as well as off-Amazon, traffic-generating channels like Facebook and Google. With its high level of consumer interest, it was clear Angry Orange had the chops to grow into DTC channels as well, contributing 21% of total sales since March 2020. Thrasio’s marketing initiatives also included influencer marketing agreements, which have evolved to include celebrity endorsements.
The original 8oz Angry Orange concentrate was a hero product that earned a loyal cult following. Thrasio took product innovation to a new level by creating a ready-to-use version of the concentrate in multiple sizes, including a gallon jug. We expanded the product line to include a ready-to-use spray for stain removal and introduced a bathroom spray in early 2020.
Angry Orange has since experienced steady growth on Amazon. Thanks to our wholesale team, consumers also can find it on retail shelves. Select Target, Walmart, Ace Hardware, and True Value stores now sell Angry Orange to shoppers across the United States.

The owner of ThisWorx founded a small brand led by one popular product – a handheld car vacuum that customers loved. Thrasio built on that success by improving the brand's search engine optimization (SEO) strategies, adding professional photos and videos, and investing in a hefty marketing push. The result? The brand became a success in only a few months.
When we first acquired ThisWorx, we were neck-and-neck with another brand offering a very similar product. Thrasio needed to identify the competitive edge to our car vacuum.
ThisWorx Deal of the Day (DOTD) turned out to be the brand's first $1 million day. Since that first deal, we've built a strategy of running as many DOTDs as possible, supplementing with lightning deals in between. To date, ThisWorx has had six $1 million days and made over $20 million on deals alone.
We increased our vacuum’s price by 17% (from $29.97 to $34.99) to make running our deal strategy possible and drive sales. It also signaled to shoppers that ThisWorx products are built with more quality and longevity than our competitors' products.
ThisWorx sold more vacuums on Prime Day in 2020 than Thrasio's whole portfolio. We experienced 405% year-over-year increase on Prime Day and now have 47X more reviews since acquisition.
Our ThisWorx branding refresh included professional photography, upgraded packaging, and strategic copy – proving ThisWorx as the higher quality choice. We've maneuvered past the competition ever since.

When we purchased Crafts 4 All, the hero product was already #1 in its category on Amazon. Thrasio built on that position by improving the brand's creative, investing heavily in pay-per-click marketing, and expanding the product line. Our supply chain team also went to work to ensure the brand never ran out of inventory – no small feat given the spike in demand caused by COVID-19.
Crafts 4 All presented a classic supply-and-demand challenge, but COVID-19 was the real hurdle to overcome. We dug deep into the manufacturing process and quickly found we'd need to shore up the brand's supply chain to ensure we could continue to make products no matter what disruption came next.
We leveraged the data and learnings from early COVID-19 supply chain scarcity into our forecasting for the 2020 holiday season. No longer constrained by on-hand inventory, we were able to sell freely in Q4 — pushing promotions and PPC for a sustained increase in sales continuing into 2021.
We packaged our top products to fit into a niche subcategory, which made it easier to consistently maintain top rank.
What can we say? We like being #1.
We launched an additional variation to the hero product. Offering three different sized kits at three different price points within an established listing drove sales with minimal impact on day-to-day operations.
Our updated branding added color to the packaging (and therefore the listing photos). Not only did the products stand out in the search results, they also made the kit a more giftable item. Our paint sets were one of the top-performing products in Q4 2020.

Our supply chain team also went to work to ensure the brand never ran out of inventory – no small feat given the spike in demand caused by COVID-19.
Crafts 4 All presented a classic supply-and-demand challenge, but COVID-19 was the real hurdle to overcome. We dug deep into the manufacturing process and quickly found we'd need to shore up the brand's supply chain to ensure we could continue to make products no matter what disruption came next.
We leveraged the data and learnings from early COVID-19 supply chain scarcity into our forecasting for the 2020 holiday season. No longer constrained by on-hand inventory, we were able to sell freely in Q4 — pushing promotions and PPC for a sustained increase in sales continuing into 2021.
We packaged our top products to fit into a niche subcategory, which made it easier to consistently maintain top rank.
What can we say? We like being #1.
We launched an additional variation to the hero product. Offering three different sized kits at three different price points within an established listing drove sales with minimal impact on day-to-day operations.
Our updated branding added color to the packaging (and therefore the listing photos). Not only did the products stand out in the search results, they also made the kit a more giftable item. Our paint sets were one of the top-performing products in Q4 2020.
*Our case studies are for general information purposes; they are not guarantees of future performance and undue reliance should not be placed on them. Each study is based on a particular set of facts and conditions at a point in time and may involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. The performance, financial results, and projections for the products or sellers in these case studies may not be parallel in others.
ThisWorx was initially a small brand led by one successful product. Thrasio improved search engine optimization, updated the photos and videos, and gave a hefty marketing push to make this brand a runaway success in only a few months.
Thrasio revamped pay-per-click marketing, launched generous customer service initiatives, and brought TrailBuddy into new marketplaces—making this brand a global success.

Als Thrasio Becky Cameron Home übernahm, war das Hauptprodukt des Unternehmens in der Kategorie Kissen auf Amazon gut platziert und hatte 12.000 Bewertungen. Wir bauten diese Position aus, indem wir kreative Updates anwandten und Marketinginitiativen von Grund auf neu aufbauten. Dies erhöhte die Verkaufsgeschwindigkeit und gab den Startschuss für eine neue Bestandsprognose – alles Teil einer umfassenden Strategie zum Wachstum der Marke.
Mit über 2.500 Amazon Standard Identification Numbers (ASINs) war Becky Cameron Home unsere bisher größte Markengewinnung. Unser erster Auftrag bestand darin, die Produktlinie zu konsolidieren, um die Vertriebsgeschwindigkeit zu steigern. Wir wussten auch, dass wir durch die Stärkung der Lieferkette drastische Kosteneinsparungen erzielen konnten.
Jeder Thrasher hat einen Beitrag zum Erfolg dieser Marke geleistet, indem er jeden Eintrag durchkämmte, um kreative SEO-Titel-Tags zu aktualisieren und sicherzustellen, dass jeder Eintrag Amazon TOS konform war. Außerdem haben wir zwei neue Lieferanten hinzugefügt und die Fertigungskapazität um das Fünffache erhöht. Wir haben dann Datensatz-Tools entwickelt, die uns helfen, eine Marke dieser Größe und größer zu verwalten.
Als wir BCH erwarben, hatte das 2er-Pack Gel Queen-Kissenset die zweithöchste Anzahl von Bewertungen in der Kategorie auf Amazon. Wir haben die Werbeausgaben deutlich erhöht und den Eintrag von SEO bis hin zum kreativen Branding optimiert. Unsere Bemühungen haben sich ausgezahlt.
Viele ASINs dieser Marke hatten keinen vollständigen Eintrag, was sich negativ auf die Suchmaschinenoptimierung auswirkte. Für jeden Eintrag haben wir das Branding mit einem neuen luxuriösen Look aktualisiert und 9 Eintragsfotos und A+-Inhalte hinzugefügt, um das Vertrauen zu stärken.
Eine solide Marketingstrategie für diese Marke bot eine große Chance, das Wachstum zu fördern. PPC war ein großer Teil dieses Ansatzes, neben anderen Maßnahmen wie Amazon-Events (z. B. Amazon Live), Affiliate-Marketing, Social Media und DTC.

Thrasio hat die PPC Kampagnen überarbeitet, großzügige Kundenservicemaßnahmen initiiert und TrailBuddy auf neue Märkte ausgeweitet — und damit die Marke zu einem globalen Erfolg geführt.

95% BSR improvement in less than 3 weeks.
Increased EBITDA ~169% since acquisition.
Increased hero ASIN sales ~487% since acquisition.
When Thrasio acquired Becky Cameron Home (BCH), the company’s hero product was already well ranked with the second-highest number of reviews in the pillow category. We leveraged this solid positioning by applying creative updates and rebuilding pay-per-click (PPC) initiatives from the ground up. This effectively accelerated sales velocity and triggered an inventory re-forecast – requiring a flexible and streamlined brand operations strategy.
With over 2,500 ASINs, BCH was the largest brand acquisition to date. We consolidated ASINs and focused on top listings, while driving dramatic cost savings by tightening up the supply chain and scaling our manufacturing capacity.
Every Thrasher had a hand in this brand's success — combing through each listing to update creative, SEO title tags, and ensure each listing was Amazon TOS compliant. We also added two two new suppliers and increased manufacturing capacity by 5X. We then built data set tools to help us manage a brand of this size and larger.
When we acquired BCH, the 2-Pack Gel Queen Pillow Set had the second-highest number of reviews in the category on Amazon. We significantly increased ad spend and optimized the listing from SEO to creative branding. Our effort paid off in a big way.
Many ASINs in this brand did not have a complete listing, which negatively affected SEO. For each listing, we updated branding with a new luxe feel and added 9 listing photos and A+ content to increase trust.
A robust marketing strategy for this brand held a big opportunity to help drive growth. PPC was a huge part of that approach, with other efforts including Amazon events (e.g. Amazon Live), affiliate marketing, social media, and DTC.
*Our case studies are for general information purposes; they are not guarantees of future performance and undue reliance should not be placed on them. Each study is based on a particular set of facts and conditions at a point in time and may involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. The performance, financial results, and projections for the products or sellers in these case studies may not be parallel in others.
We took a commercial-grade product and made it consumer ready, increasing revenue from $2.5 million to $16.5 million. In the process, this brand became so beloved, it expanded beyond Amazon to be sold in retail stores across the country.
Thrasio revamped PPC, launched generous customer service initiatives, and brought TrailBuddy into new marketplaces—making this brand a global success.

When Thrasio acquired TrailBuddy — an outdoor brand with two separate storefronts — the company already had a solid reputation for making top-quality products. Both its trekking poles and boulder net products held Best Seller Badges and had strong Best Sellers Ranks in Amazon's sports & outdoor category. We immediately saw opportunities to build on TrailBuddy's position.
TrailBuddy was already a healthy brand, so the best path forward for growth was to increase visibility to shoppers. Thrasio revamped the brand's pay-per-click marketing strategies, launched generous customer service initiatives, and brought TrailBuddy into new global markets and online channels.
After wins in the U.S., Thrasio’s international team launched TrailBuddy trekking poles in Canada and the UK. The growth was impressive. In Canada, TrailBuddy reached the #1 Best Sellers Rank in under two weeks. On the third day in the UK market, TrailBuddy trekking poles reached #2 in search results.
We safeguarded the 4.7-star rating with generous customer service initiatives that go above and beyond customer expectations. Today, our customer obsession team has an average response time of about 2 hours. We also track trending customer suggestions for product improvements and immediately share that feedback with brand management to develop even stronger products in the future.
We took every advertisement opportunity Amazon offers with this brand. In the first year we owned the business, we made a 6-figure investment in pay-per-click marketing to build volume.
Our model allows us to make early strategic investments that lead to long-term gains for our brands.
After testing the quality and durability of our competitors’ products, we were confident TrailBuddy was a high-quality brand. That allowed us to experiment with new distribution and marketing strategies without the risk of sacrificing ratings and reviews. The data and insights we gained from that test-and-learn period now inform growth strategies for other brands in our portfolio.

Thrasio grew Crafts 4 All over 3X in just 2 years with vibrant packaging, heavily invested PPC, and an expanded product line. Our secret to maintaining its #1 rank? Never run out of inventory.

Steigerung des EBITDA um 148% innerhalb von 2 Jahren nach Übernahme.
Umsatzsteigerung um ca. 90% innerhalb von 2 Jahren nach Übernahme.
Als wir Crafts 4 All gekauft haben, war das Heldenprodukt bereits die Nummer 1 in seiner Kategorie auf Amazon. Thrasio baute diese Position aus, indem es die Kreativität der Marke verbesserte, stark in Pay-per-Click-Marketing investierte und die Produktpalette erweiterte. Unser Supply-Chain-Team sorgte außerdem dafür, dass der Marke nie die Bestände ausgingen – keine Kleinigkeit angesichts der durch COVID-19 verursachten Nachfrage.
Crafts 4 All stellte eine klassische Herausforderung für Angebot und Nachfrage dar, aber COVID-19 war die eigentliche Hürde, die es zu überwinden galt. Wir tauchten tief in den Fertigungsprozess ein und fanden schnell heraus, dass wir die Lieferkette der Marke stärken müssten, um sicherzustellen, dass wir weiterhin Produkte herstellen können, unabhängig davon, welche Unterbrechung als Nächstes eintritt.
Wir haben die Daten und Erkenntnisse aus der frühen COVID-19-Lieferkettenknappheit in unsere Prognosen für die Weihnachtssaison 2020 einfließen lassen. Wir konnten im 4. Quartal 2021 frei verkaufen und trieben verstärkt Angebote und PPC, um eine nachhaltige Umsatzsteigerung im Jahr 2021 zu haben.
Wir haben unsere Top-Produkte so verpackt, dass sie in eine Nischenunterkategorie passen, was es einfacher macht, den Spitzenplatz zu halten.
Was sollen wir sagen? Wir sind gerne die Nummer 1.
Wir haben eine zusätzliche Variante des Heldenprodukts eingeführt. Drei Kits in verschiedenen Größen zu drei verschiedenen Preispunkten in einem etablierten Listing trieben den Umsatz mit minimalen Auswirkungen auf den Tagesbetrieb voran.
Unser aktualisiertes Branding brachte Farbe in die Verpackung (und damit auch in die Angebotsfotos). Die Produkte heben sich nicht nur in den Suchergebnissen ab, sondern machen das Kit auch zu einem besseren Geschenkartikel. Unsere Farbsätze waren eines der leistungsstärksten Produkte im 4. Quartal 2020.

Thrasio hat die PPC Kampagnen überarbeitet, großzügige Kundenservicemaßnahmen initiiert und TrailBuddy auf neue Märkte ausgeweitet — und damit die Marke zu einem globalen Erfolg geführt.

Ranks #1 in several subcategories as a top crafting competitor.
Increased EBITDA by ~239% within 2 years of acquisition.
Increased revenue by ~152% within 2 years of acquisition.
When we purchased Crafts 4 All, the hero ASIN was already #1 in its category. Thrasio applied creative updates, invested heavily in PPC, expanded the product line, and worked aggressively to maintain the #1 rank by committing to the goal of never running out of inventory. The COVID-19 sales spike in the category put our products in high demand. We were able to maintain inventory and increase sales velocity as other sellers stocked out.
We dug deep into the manufacturing process involved in making the product and found that without making key supply chain improvements, Crafts 4 All inventory would always be unstable.
We leveraged the data and learnings from early COVID-19 supply chain scarcity into our forecasting for the 2020 holiday season. No longer constrained by on-hand inventory, we were able to sell freely in Q4 — pushing promotions and PPC even harder for a sustained increase in sales continuing into 2021.

The owner of ThisWorx founded a small brand led by one popular product – a handheld car vacuum that customers loved. Thrasio built on that success by improving the brand's search engine optimization (SEO) strategies, adding professional photos and videos, and investing in a hefty marketing push. The result? The brand became a success in only a few months.
When we first acquired ThisWorx, we were neck-and-neck with another brand offering a very similar product. Thrasio needed to identify the competitive edge to our car vacuum.
ThisWorx Deal of the Day (DOTD) turned out to be the brand's first $1 million day. Since that first deal, we've built a strategy of running as many DOTDs as possible, supplementing with lightning deals in between. To date, ThisWorx has had six $1 million days and made over $20 million on deals alone.
We increased our vacuum’s price by 17% (from $29.97 to $34.99) to make running our deal strategy possible and drive sales. It also signaled to shoppers that ThisWorx products are built with more quality and longevity than our competitors' products.
ThisWorx sold more vacuums on Prime Day in 2020 than Thrasio's whole portfolio. We experienced 405% year-over-year increase on Prime Day and now have 47X more reviews since acquisition.
Our ThisWorx branding refresh included professional photography, upgraded packaging, and strategic copy – proving ThisWorx as the higher quality choice. We've maneuvered past the competition ever since.

When Thrasio acquired TrailBuddy — an outdoor brand with two separate storefronts — the company already had a solid reputation for making top-quality products. Both its trekking poles and boulder net products held Best Seller Badges and had strong Best Sellers Ranks in Amazon's sports & outdoor category. We immediately saw opportunities to build on TrailBuddy's position.
TrailBuddy was already a healthy brand, so the best path forward for growth was to increase visibility to shoppers. Thrasio revamped the brand's pay-per-click marketing strategies, launched generous customer service initiatives, and brought TrailBuddy into new global markets and online channels.
After wins in the U.S., Thrasio’s international team launched TrailBuddy trekking poles in Canada and the UK. The growth was impressive. In Canada, TrailBuddy reached the #1 Best Sellers Rank in under two weeks. On the third day in the UK market, TrailBuddy trekking poles reached #2 in search results.
We safeguarded the 4.7-star rating with generous customer service initiatives that go above and beyond customer expectations. Today, our customer obsession team has an average response time of about 2 hours.

Erhöhung des ThisWorx Best Sellers Rank (BSR) um 98 %.
Der Eigentümer von ThisWorx gründete eine kleine Marke, die sich auf ein beliebtes Produkt stützte – einen Handstaubsauger für Autos, der bei den Kunden sehr beliebt war. Thrasio baute auf diesem Erfolg auf, indem er die Suchmaschinenoptimierungsstrategien der Marke verbessert, professionelle Fotos und Videos hinzufügt und in einen hochkarätigen Marketing-Push investiert. Das Ergebnis? Die Marke wurde in nur wenigen Monaten zu einem durchschlagenden Erfolg.
Als wir ThisWorx erworben haben, lieferten wir uns ein Kopf-an-Kopf-Rennen mit einer anderen Marke, die ein sehr ähnliches Produkt anbot. Thrasio musste den Wettbewerbsvorteil unseres Autostaubsaugers ermitteln.
ThisWorx Deal of the Day (DOTD) stellte sich als der erste 1 Mio. $-Tag der Marke heraus. Seit diesem ersten Geschäft haben wir eine Strategie entwickelt, die so viele DOTDs wie möglich durchführt und dazwischen andere Angebot einfügt. Bis heute hatte ThisWorx sechs Tage mit mehr als 1 Mio. $ und hat allein mit Geschäften über 20 Mio. $ verdient.
Wir haben den Preis unseres Staubsaugers um 17 % (von 29,97 $ auf 34,99 $) erhöht, um unsere Geschäftsstrategie möglich zu machen und den Umsatz zu steigern. Außerdem signalisiert es Käufern, dass ThisWorx-Produkte mit höherer Qualität und Langlebigkeit als die Produkte unserer Wettbewerber entwickelt wurden.
ThisWorx hat am Prime Day 2020 mehr Staubsauger verkauft als das gesamte Portfolio von Thrasio. Wir verzeichneten am Prime Day einen Zuwachs von 405 % im Vergleich zum Vorjahr und haben seit der Übernahme nun 47 Mal mehr Bewertungen.
Unsere Umgestaltung des ThisWorx-Brandings umfasste professionelle Fotografie, eine verbesserte Verpackung und strategische Texte – und bewies damit, dass ThisWorx die bessere Wahl ist. Seitdem haben wir die Konkurrenz hinter uns gelassen.

The founder made 100% of his earnout in 2021.
Average daily sales have increased by 8X.
Increased revenue ~785% since acquisition.
The owner of ThisWorx founded a small brand led by one successful product. Thrasio applied new SEO title tags, creative content, and a hefty marketing push to quickly elevate the brand. Expert brand management and pay-per-click (PPC) initiatives made this brand a runaway success within the first few months post-acquisition. After increasing the ThisWorx Best Seller Rank by 98% in just three weeks, the brand's hero products are now #1 and #2 in certain car-related categories.
When we first acquired ThisWorx, we were neck-and-neck with another brand offering a very similar product. Thrasio needed to identify the competitive edge to our car vacuum.
ThisWorx Deal of the Day (DOTD) turned out to be the brand's first $1M day. Since that first deal, we've built a strategy of running as many DOTDs as possible, supplementing with lightning deals in between. To date, ThisWorx has had six $1M+ days, and made over $20M on deals alone.
We increased our vacuum’s price by 17% (from $29.97 to $34.99) to make running our deal strategy possible and drive sales. It also signaled to shoppers that ThisWorx products are built with more quality and longevity than our competitors' products.
ThisWorx sold more vacuums on Prime Day in 2020 than Thrasio's whole portfolio. We experienced 405% year-over-year increase on Prime Day and now have 47X more reviews since acquisition.
Our ThisWorx branding refresh included professional photography, upgraded packaging, and strategic copy – proving ThisWorx as the higher quality choice. We've blown past the competition ever since.

Als Thrasio TrailBuddy — eine Outdoor-Marke mit zwei separaten Shops — erwarb, hatte das Unternehmen bereits einen soliden Ruf für die Herstellung qualitativ hochwertiger Produkte. Sowohl seine Laufstangen als auch seine Schulternetzprodukte hielten die besten Seller Badges und hatten starke Best Seller Ratings in der Kategorie Sport & Outdoor von Amazon. Wir sahen sofort Möglichkeiten, die starke Position von TrailBuddy auszubauen.
TrailBuddy war bereits eine gesunde Marke, so dass der beste Weg für Wachstum darin bestand, die Sichtbarkeit bei den Käufern zu erhöhen. Thrasio hat die PPC Kampagnen überarbeitet, großzügige Kundenservicemaßnahmen initiiert und TrailBuddy auf neue Märkte und Onlinekanäle ausgeweitet.
Nach den Erfolgen in den USA führte das internationale Team von Thrasio die TrailBuddy-Trekkingstöcke in Kanada und Großbritannien ein. Das Wachstum war explosiv. In Kanada erreichte TrailBuddy in weniger als zwei Wochen die Nummer 1 der Bestsellerliste. Am dritten Tag auf dem britischen Markt erreichten die TrailBuddy-Trekkingstöcke Platz 2 der Suchergebnisse.
Wir haben die 4,7-Sterne-Bewertung mit großzügigen Kundenservice-Initiativen gesichert, die über die Kundenerwartungen hinausgehen. Heute hat unser kundenbesessenes Team eine durchschnittliche Reaktionszeit von etwa 2 Stunden. Außerdem verfolgen wir die Vorschläge von Trendkunden für Produktverbesserungen und geben dieses Feedback sofort an das Markenmanagement weiter, um in Zukunft noch bessere Produkte zu entwickeln.
Wir haben jede Werbemöglichkeit mit dieser Marke genutzt, die Amazon bietet. Im ersten Jahr, in dem wir das Unternehmen besaßen, investierten wir einen 6-stelligen Betrag in PPC, um das Volumen zu erhöhen.
Unser Modell ermöglicht es uns, frühzeitig strategische Investitionen zu tätigen, die zu langfristigen Gewinnen für unsere Marken führen.
Nachdem wir die Qualität und Langlebigkeit der Produkte unserer Wettbewerber getestet hatten, waren wir zuversichtlich, dass TrailBuddy eine hochwertige Marke war. So konnten wir mit neuen Vertriebs- und Marketingstrategien experimentieren, ohne das Risiko einzugehen, dass die Bewertungen und Rezensionen verloren gehen.
Die Daten und Erkenntnisse, die wir aus dieser Test- und Lernphase gewonnen haben, fließen nun in die Wachstumsstrategien für andere Marken in unserem Portfolio ein.

Der durchschnittliche monatliche Pay-per-Click-Umsatz stieg von 2019 bis Oktober 2021 um 1860 %.
Angry Orange, ein Spray zur Beseitigung von Haustiergerüchen, war eine 4 Jahre alte Marke, die jährlich einen Umsatz von über 2 Millionen US-Dollar generierte, als der Gründer Adam St. George beschloss, sich aus dem Amazon FBA-Geschäft zurückzuziehen. Innerhalb einer Woche nach dem Treffen mit dem Team von Thrasio war das Geschäft abgeschlossen.
Dieses kommerzielle Produkt war ein durchschlagender Erfolg, aber die Marke musste verbrauchertauglich gemacht werden. Der einzige logische Schritt war ein umfassendes Rebranding der gesamten Angry Orange-Produktlinie.
Um das Produkt verbrauchertauglich zu machen, haben wir die Verpackung komplett überarbeitet. Ein umfassendes Rebranding der Produktlinie Angry Orange erzählte eine Geschichte, die auch das Vertrauen der Verbraucher stärkte.
Diese Verbesserungen führen zu wirkungsvollen Optimierungen von Listings und betonen die Geschichte und den Wert der Marke in den Texten der Listings, Bildern und Videos sowie A+-Inhalten.
Das Marketingteam von Thrasio trieb das Wachstum sowohl durch Platzierungen auf Amazon als auch durch Traffic-erzeugende Kanäle außerhalb von Amazon wie Facebook und Google voran. Angesichts des großen Verbraucherinteresses war klar, dass Angry Orange das Zeug dazu hatte, auch in den DTC-Kanälen zu wachsen und seit März 2020 21 % zum Gesamtumsatz beizutragen. Die Marketinginitiativen von Thrasio umfassten auch Influencer-Marketingvereinbarungen, die sich weiterentwickelt haben, um Promi-Empfehlungen einzubeziehen.
Das ursprüngliche 8oz Angry Orange Konzentrat war ein Vorzeigeprodukt, das einen treuen Kultstatus genoss. Thrasio hat die Produktinnovation durch die Entwicklung einer gebrauchsfertigen Version des Konzentrats in verschiedenen Größen, einschließlich eines Gallonenkrugs, auf ein neues Niveau gebracht. Wir haben die Produktreihe um ein sofort einsatzfähiges Spray erweitert, um Flecken zu entfernen, und Anfang 2020 wurde ein Badezimmerspray eingeführt.
Angry Orange hat seitdem ein stetiges Wachstum auf Amazon erlebt. Dank unseres Großhandelsteams können Verbraucher es auch in den Einzelhandelsregalen finden. Wählen Sie Target-, Walmart-, Ace Hardware- und True Value-Geschäfte, um Angry Orange jetzt an Käufer in den USA zu verkaufen.

Seller achieved 100% of his earnout.
Average monthly PPC sales increased 1,860%.
Increased revenue 11X to $23.1 million.
Angry Orange, a pet-odor eliminator, was a 4-year-old brand generating more than $2 million in annual revenue when Adam St. George decided to exit the Amazon FBA game. Within a week of introductions with Thrasio, the deal was done.
This commercial-grade product was a smashing success, but the brand needed to become consumer-ready. The only logical move was a comprehensive rebrand of the entire Angry Orange product line.
To make the product consumer-ready, we completely revamped the packaging. A comprehensive rebrand of the Angry Orange product line told a story that also built consumer trust.
These improvements lent themselves to impactful listing optimizations, emphasizing the brand story and value within listing copy, imagery and video, and A+ content.
Thrasio’s marketing team drove growth from both on-Amazon placements as well as off-Amazon, traffic-generating channels like Facebook and Google. With its high level of consumer interest, it was clear Angry Orange had the chops to grow into DTC channels as well, contributing 21% of total sales since March 2020. Thrasio’s marketing initiatives also included influencer marketing agreements, which have evolved to include celebrity endorsements.
The original 8oz Angry Orange concentrate was a hero product that earned a loyal cult following. Thrasio took product innovation to a new level by creating a ready-to-use version of the concentrate in multiple sizes, including a gallon jug. We expanded the product line to include a ready-to-use spray for stain removal and introduced a bathroom spray in early 2020.
Angry Orange has since experienced steady growth on Amazon. Thanks to our wholesale team, consumers also can find it on retail shelves. Select Target, Walmart, Ace Hardware, and True Value stores now sell Angry Orange to shoppers across the United States.

Some say fortune favors the brave. Josh and Carlos’ good fortune started when they met while working on a purpose-driven jewelry brand called Bravelets, founded by current Thrasio COO Stephanie Fox. Though the company was initially successful, environmental factors and a lack of resources kept it from growing to its maximum potential. This gave them an idea: What if they could roll up struggling ecommerce companies into one portfolio and use a single set of operators and scalable processes to take them to the next level? Talk about entering a brave new world. Together, they disrupted the 3P marketplace on Amazon and established a category that has gone on to inspire hundreds of competitors.

Während Thrasio expandiert, arbeiten wir hart daran, dass unser globales Bewusstsein noch schneller wächst. Unser Einfluss auf die Umwelt und die Gemeinden hilft uns bei der Entscheidungsfindung.
Im Rahmen unseres Programms für verantwortungsbewusste Beschaffung arbeiten wir mit dem weltweit führenden Wirtschaftsverband für offenen und nachhaltigen Handel amfori zusammen, um Instrumente und bewährte Verfahren zur Bewertung der sozialen Leistung unserer Lieferkette einzuführen. Die Lieferanten verpflichten sich, den amfori-Verhaltenskodex zu folgen, der 11 Grundsätze umfasst: von fairer Bezahlung bis zum Umweltschutz.
Im Rahmen unserer Initiative zur Nachhaltigkeit in der Lieferkette haben wir den Standard des Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol übernommen, um unsere Treibhausgasemissionen zu messen, zu verwalten und zu melden. Darüber hinaus haben wir uns mit Pathzero zusammengetan, um die GHG-Emissionen von Port-to-Port-Frachtgeschäften anhand der im Protokoll festgelegten Best Practices einzuschätzen.
Um die Gemeinschaften, in denen wir leben und arbeiten, zu stärken, haben wir bedeutsame, unterhaltsame und wirkungsvolle Mentoring- und philanthropische Möglichkeiten geschaffen.
Das Stipendium von Thrasio in Zusammenarbeit mit der Success Academy (SA) in Harlem bietet High-School-Schülern die Möglichkeit, von unseren Mitarbeitern zu lernen, wie man ein soziales Unternehmen von Grund auf recherchiert, aufbaut und erweitert. Stipendiaten arbeiten in Teams und werden nach mehreren Workshops mit Seed-Finanzierung belohnt, um in ihren Communitys mindestens ein akzeptables Produkt oder eine tragbare Dienstleistung zu starten. So wie Amazon es für kleine und mittlere Unternehmen (KMU) getan hat, hoffen wir auch, das Unternehmertum weiter zu demokratisieren, indem wir Studenten frühzeitig dazu inspirieren, ihr Potenzial als Unternehmer der Zukunft zu erkunden.
Mentorin bei BUILD zu sein, war eine sehr beeindruckende und aufschlussreiche Erfahrung. Es ist unglaublich zu sehen, mit welcher Leidenschaft ein Konzept in ein Produkt umgesetzt wird, auf das die Schüler stolz sind. Die Arbeit bei Thrasio gibt mir das Selbstvertrauen, diesen Studenten zu sagen, dass es eine Welt gibt, die ihren Unternehmergeist schätzt und ihre Lösungsfähigkeiten braucht.
Die Möglichkeit, meiner eigenen Mittelschule etwas zurückzugeben, war eine unglaubliche berufliche Leistung, die auch für mich persönlich sehr wichtig ist. Ich bin begeistert, dass ich in den Gemeinden, in denen ich aufgewachsen bin, etwas bewirken kann, und dass ich klugen jungen Köpfen neue Karrieremöglichkeiten eröffnen kann.
Wir ermutigen die Thrasher, unsere Politik der unbegrenzten bezahlten Freistellung zu nutzen und sich für die Themen einzusetzen, die ihnen am wichtigsten sind.
Machen Sie sich mit einer Gruppe positiver Menschen auf, die Zukunft zu gestalten.

As Thrasio expands across the world, we are committed to growing our global consciousness even faster. Our impact on the environment and the opportunity to lift people up help guide every decision we make.
Through our Responsible Sourcing Program, we partner with amfori, the leading global business association for open and sustainable trade, to implement tools and best practices that evaluate the social performance of our supply chain. Suppliers are committed to follow the amfori code of conduct – 11 principles ranging from fair payments to environmental protection.
As part of our Supply Chain Sustainability initiative, we’ve adopted the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol standard to measure, manage, and report our GHG emissions. We've also partnered with Pathzero to estimate GHG emissions from port-to-port freight operations, following best practices as specified in the Protocol.
To strengthen the communities in which we live and work, we’ve created meaningful, fun, and high-engagement mentorship and philanthropic opportunities.
Thrasio’s fellowship in collaboration with Success Academy (SA) in Harlem offers high school students the opportunity to learn from our employees how to research, build, and scale a social enterprise from scratch. Fellows work in teams and, after a series of workshops, are awarded seed funding to launch a minimum viable product or service in their communities. As Amazon has done for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), we also hope to further democratize entrepreneurship by inspiring students early on to explore their potential as the entrepreneurs of the future.
Being a mentor at BUILD has been a very humbling and eye-opening experience. It is incredible to see the passion that goes into developing a concept into a product that the students are proud of. Working at Thrasio gives me the confidence to tell these students that there is a world that values their entrepreneurial spirits and needs their problem-solving skills.
Being able to give back to my own middle school was an incredible professional accomplishment that’s also very important to me personally. I’m thrilled to be able to impact the communities where I grew up and to potentially introduce new career possibilities for bright young minds.
We encourage Thrashers to utilize our unlimited paid time off policy and take action on issues that are most meaningful to them.
Take off with a group of positive people out to define the future.

Our leadership team is made up of Amazon veterans, e-commerce connoisseurs and successful entrepreneurs who are at the forefront of rethinking the way products are brought to the world.
Wer wagt, gewinnt. Josh Silberstein und Carlos Cashman verkörpern dieses Motto. Die beiden Thrasio Gründer trafen sich bei der Arbeit an einer Kampagne für die Schmuckmarke Bravelets von Stephanie Fox, die heute COO bei Thrasio ist. Trotz anfänglichen Erfolgen konnte die Marke aufgrund von externen Faktoren und mangelnden Ressourcen jedoch nie ihr volles Potenzial entfalten. Das brachte das Team auf eine Idee: Könnte man angeschlagene E-Commerce-Shops aufkaufen und diese mit Hilfe von skalierbaren Prozessen in die nächste Liga befördern? Gemeinsam wagten sie sich auf ein völlig neues Terrain vor. Dabei haben sie nicht nur den Amazon-Markt für Dritt-Anbieter aufgemischt, sondern eine komplett neue Branche geschaffen, deren Erfolg hunderte von Wettbewerbern hervorgebracht hat.

Wir sind bessere Unternehmer geworden, denn jetzt haben wir ein gutes Modell für die Entwicklung weiterer Marken – und wir können uns auf die Unterstützung durch Thrasio jederzeit verlassen.
Ich bin beeindruckt, wie schnell Thrasio ans Werk geht, wie fair ihr Angebot war und wie gut sie mit unserer Unternehmensvision übereinstimmen. Ich habe mein zweites und drittes Geschäft ebenfalls an Thrasio verkauft.
Thrasio war in der Lage, über das Jahr 2020 hinweg konstant hohe Umsatzzahlen zu generieren – und das trotz der zahlreichen COVID-Einschränkungen für Produktion, Logistik und Versand. Für mich besteht kein Zweifel, dass sie diesen Herausforderungen besser als ich gewachsen waren.

We bring products people love to the world.
At Thrasio, we’re reimagining how to make the world’s most-loved products accessible to everyone. So we work with successful sellers, using a deep understanding of rankings, ratings, and reviews – plus supply chain and marketing smarts – to transform the art and science of commerce.
We now feel like stronger business owners because we have a solid model for structuring any future brands we build—and can count on Thrasio to have our backs at any time.
I love how quickly Thrasio can move, how fair they are with their valuation, and how well they aligned with our vision. I returned to Thrasio to sell my second and third businesses.
Thrasio was able to consistently keep revenue strong through 2020 despite the numerous manufacturing, logistic, fulfillment constraints so many sellers faced during COVID. I don’t doubt they handled the account better than I could have myself given the same challenges.
Take a page from Thrasio’s playbook.
Actually, take 50 pages.

from Amazon’s Prime Early Access Sale (“PEAS”) is revealing that the products with big sales didn’t come with big price tags. For Thrasio, this meant the event and many of our brands went together like PEAS and carrots, with several of those brands having their best days yet.
In our new Q&A series “Best in Thras,” we teased out some reflections on PEAS with three questions for three Thrashers whose brands cooked the competition.
. It snatched a top spot in Lightning Deals and reached #2 best-seller status in pet supplies.
136,440 hours of colorful dancing flames keeping customers warm this winter.
™ glow-in-the-dark basketballs, footballs, and soccer balls. All three products simultaneously held the #1 best-seller spot during the sale, and the brand absolutely crushed it with sales 1,000% bigger than July’s Prime Day, for its biggest Prime Day yet.
Why was your brand successful during this event?
Choosing an attractive price point for our customers helps a lot.
In addition, we were able to obtain a lot of affiliate assistance for external traffic while leveraging coupons.
: We ran three Lightning Deals on the top Magical Flames listings, stacking them with coupons and exclusive discounts for affiliate/influencer partners, to create attractive final price points for our customers across all pack sizes. Additionally, leading into PEAS, we launched 600+ new Amazon PPC campaigns, which drove rank and sessions on key upper funnel keywords.
: We leaned into the available Amazon promotions, ran analysis of deals on those promotional prices, and had great discounts at a great time of year. Soccer, football and basketball seasons are all starting, it’s getting darker outside earlier and GlowCity is a great gift for the holidays.
How will you extend and/or learn from that success to have a strong Turkey 5?
: We will continue to push for brand recognition off of Amazon by working with affiliates, running Facebook ads, and leveraging TikTok – as well as YouTube soon.
for conversions and brand recognition while running a Top Deal. We are also making sure we are positioned with enough inventory to sell through November, December, and deals.
: Given the historical “stocking stuffer” appeal for Magical Flames, we will lean heavily into this theme heading into T5 via strategic copy updates, paid traffic campaigns, and affiliate/influencer coverage. Improving brand exposure for Magical Flames on these search terms will enable our Turkey 5 Lightning Deals to reach a larger set of customers. Furthermore, we will look beyond Turkey 5 to continue offering attractive deals up until the Christmas delivery cutoff.
: Inventory is not unlimited, so we’ll set specific deal unit limits to maintain healthy inventory throughout Q4.
On T5, a deal can really take off, which is great. But you want to make sure you leave inventory to capture higher margin sales from the “halo” effect of deals. On GlowCity, our sales were up nearly 100 percent the week following PEAS compared to the week before.
What piece of advice would you give to sellers coming out of PEAS?
: Leverage coupons and price your product to sell during high traffic events. Then ride the algorithm spike wave at a higher price point.
: Do not undersell the power of deal and coupon stacking when trying to improve your deals page placement. Stacked coupons may not be visible on the deals page, but they positively impact conversion, which bodes well with Amazon’s ranking algorithm.
: Nothing too extraordinary here; run some final optimization tests over the next few weeks (creative, copy, etc.), work to have strong keyword rank the week leading into T5, and utilize the promotions Amazon offers. Choose the promotions that match the goals for your products – promotions have varying discounts and expected lifts.

External traffic is critical to boosting sales and revenue from your Amazon listings. Measuring its performance is simple with this solution.
Rising PPC costs. Shifting consumer behavior. Increased competition. Just when you think you’ve got a handle on the best marketing strategy to drive sales to your Amazon FBA business, a new challenge pops up like some twisted game of Whac-A-Mole. That’s why it’s never been more important to have a comprehensive strategy that meets consumers wherever they are and is capable of handling new tests and surprises.
or preparing to sell, this tool will make your marketing efforts more fruitful and possibly increase the valuation of your company.
What is Amazon Attribution?
. Amazon Attribution is a solution created by Amazon to serve a similar need: the measurement of marketing channel performance on your site; in this case, that refers to non-Amazon marketing channel performance on your Amazon listing.
As you might know, advertisers are unable to place tracking pixels on their Amazon listings – so this tool is key to tracking your marketing performance. While still in beta, Amazon Attribution has been around for some time. It allows you to append URL parameters to your ads and pass information like campaign, ad group, channel, and publisher to the attribution console. This allows you to measure detailed product views (DPVs), add to carts (ATCs), units sold, total revenue, and more from your external traffic campaigns.
In addition to informing better ad spend decisions, Amazon Attribution ensures you have line of sight into conversions, which are paramount to ranking well in organic Amazon searches. Driving too much non-converting traffic to your listing risks hurting your Amazon SEO performance. In addition, advertisers receive a referral bonus from Amazon for every sale they generate via Amazon Attribution (more on this later).
.
From here you have two options: create the campaign manually or upload a file to create in bulk.
We recommend leveraging the bulk file creation flow if you’re starting with a paid search campaign. If you’re testing a paid social campaign you can use the manual creation flow.
Once you have the template you’ll want to create your campaign in the Google Ads editor and post it to Google/Bing as paused. From there you’ll need to download your keywords from Google and input the data into the bulk upload template columns below. Next, add the products you’d like to track in the products section.
Once the final URL suffix is added you’re ready to launch your campaign! There are also third-party tools that automate this process, but the manual flow is a great place to start if you’re using attribution for the first time.
As with any marketing tool, Amazon Attribution does have limitations. It’s important to note that once a campaign is launched it takes two full days for sales data to backfill completely. Because of this, we recommend ramping up campaigns gradually so you can optimize based on conversion data before really scaling up.
Amazon Attribution also uses a last-click attribution model with a 14-day look-back window. This model gives full credit for a sale or conversion to the touchpoint a customer last clicked on or engaged with before making a purchase. This is critical to keep in mind when analyzing campaign performance, because single-touch attribution models only tell part of the story.
Finally, to maintain user privacy Amazon masks conversion data for keywords that have not met the required daily click threshold. The banner below will indicate if you’re experiencing conversion masking in your campaigns.
This click threshold is cumulative, which means that viewing conversion data at the campaign level will provide the most accurate conversion amount for your campaigns. The click threshold is small but must be met for conversion data to appear. Conversions will not show at the ad group level if the particular ad group has not met that daily click threshold.
. On average, brands can earn a 10 percent bonus from qualifying sales simply by signing up. To calculate how much you may receive, multiply your qualifying sales from the relevant product category by the corresponding minimum bonus rate in the table below. Amazon now includes this amount in the reporting section of Attribution.
There is a two-month waiting period to receive the credit to your account, which accommodates order cancellations and customer returns. This bonus can really add up over time: one of our products, for example, generated $60k in referral bonus money over a seven-month period. The cherry on top? The bonus money also helps make leveraging external traffic easier for low-margin products.
Amazon Attribution is an easy tool to learn and a powerful way to keep growing your FBA business. The time you put into using it will easily pay off in the long run. Whether you’re currently running external campaigns or are planning to in the future, make sure to use it to track your sales.

------------------------
Reeling in ecommerce sales takes skill. But to tackle new markets, you need new tools in your box. Our sales chief helps you cast a wider net.
Your megahit coffee frother nabbed the Amazon Best Seller Badge moooonths ago. In fact, your whole line of coffee products are buzzworthy category leaders. Revenue is up and so are your margins. Impressive? You bet. But your growth doesn’t have to stop there.
For businesses at the peak of their Amazon game, the next step is brewing up a strong omnichannel strategy.
What is omnichannel?
People often use the term “omnichannel” when they’re simply selling products through multiple marketplaces and channels – Amazon, direct to consumer (DTC), retail, and maybe social commerce. But the endgame for a true omnichannel strategy is complete integration, so that your markets, sales data, the customer experience, and the brand are all part of one intelligent ecosystem. Each piece plays a role in lifting the business and delivers a personalized experience to the customer.
notes that over 85% of shopping is still happening in physical stores.
Is your brand retail ready?
Your product has to be unique.
at a great price.
You need a gross profit margin of at least 50%.
Wholesaling can yield excellent gross margins – and more control over those margins. You set your price, and (in general) it sticks, which makes it different from selling through Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), says Esposito. “It’s not a daily battle to fix your price against your competitors’ pricing, which can lead you to a dangerous race to the bottom.” You’re also not paying FBA fees or pouring money into pay-per-click ads to get eyes on your product page. But you will be fulfilling your own wholesale orders and complying with unique terms associated with major retail. You’ll incur more operating costs due to shipping errors, product returns, payment terms, and many unique service requirements by retailer. So you’ve got to be able to maintain healthy profit margins before considering a run at retail.
Assume you’re going to sell your product to retailers at a wholesale price that is a 50% discount from your full FBA retail. Depending on the category of the product, that’s a good rule of thumb (also known as keystone pricing).
Do your research.
For certain categories, like cleaning supplies, there are more than a dozen national retailers that could sell your product. In other categories, like toys, you may only be able to place your product with three or four retailers – saturating your opportunities fairly quickly.
To test the waters, think about what kind of store you want your product to be in and why. What else is on the shelves in that store? What makes your product different from those other brands? What customers are you trying to reach? And why is your product going to make a difference in their lives?
The answers to these questions are going to guide your retail strategy – what stores you’re going after and how you’re going to craft your pitch to their buyers (but more on that later).
What are the drawbacks?
Supply chain is different for retail. You need to partner with a third-party logistics (3PL) company that can fulfill retail and have a systems infrastructure that connects you seamlessly to your 3PL and customer. You’ll be challenged to meet different compliance regulations or standards for both your products and packaging – and again, these challenges can and will differ by retailer. This may require legal advice or design expertise. Traditional retail triggers a fundamentally different operating structure than an FBA brand.
Managing supply chain and inventory is one of the biggest challenges of moving from FBA to an in-store environment. In retail in particular, stocking out is just not an option. Empty shelves are a retailer’s money-losing nightmare. If you miss orders, you could be hit with hefty chargebacks that could sink your brand, not to mention your reputation among buyers. If you become a headache for a buyer, you’ll lose their business for good.
In retail, people really do shop with their eyes first, which also means you need a great packaging designer who gets the voice of your brand and can make your product stand out on store shelves. The retail shopper is confronted by a sea of products and packaging, and you have a split second to attract their attention and highlight the uniqueness of your product!
So how do you get your products in front of buyers?
According to Esposito, there are a few ways you can get your foot in the door with retailers.
First, attend trade shows for your category. Say you’re in the pet category. Just start Googling “top pet retail trade shows,” find one that looks like it suits your product best, and sign up. You’ll meet a lot of mom and pop buyers, but you’ll also build your network and learn from other attendees. Esposito also recommends setting up an account on faire.com, which is like an Amazon for wholesalers.
Another approach would be to contact a manufacturer’s representative. Again, a Google search will bring up a number of experienced representatives who know the industry and have established relationships with the buyers you’re trying to get your product in front of. They tend to work on a 5% commission for major accounts, but the cost might be well worth the guidance they provide. You can also meet these reps at trade shows or through referrals.
Lastly, try good old-fashioned cold calling. If you have a successful “digitally native” brand and can tout a category leadership position with great reviews, most retail merchants will give you a look. Bombard them with samples and category knowledge and they may be your next best friend!
When an omnichannel strategy is firing on all cylinders, all the channels synergistically play a role in lifting overall sales and building brand equity. “We call it the flywheel effect,” says Esposito.
. The pet odor eliminator spray is on the shelves of many Target and PetSmart stores. Someone shopping for dog food in Target may see a bottle of Angry Orange pet odor eliminator and not initially buy it. But later, when they’re searching for pet odor eliminator products on their phone and Angry Orange appears with an average customer review rating of 4.4 out of 5 stars, the customer knows it’s a trusted brand. After they pull the trigger on a purchase, we can then retarget that customer for additional purchases of Angry Orange products through ads on Amazon and Google.
We first brought Angry Orange to a few hardware stores. Products flew off the shelves, and we were able to share that success as proof positive that Angry Orange could make money for other national retailers.
If you’re a top seller in your category, chances are you’ve got a great product. And getting that product into as many hands as possible means meeting customers where they are – on their computers, their phones, and yes – in brick-and-mortar stores too.

By selling quality hammocks at an affordable price, Wise Owl founder Sarah Douglass hopes to help people make more lasting memories in nature.
, Sarah Douglass, remembers the day that she and her husband, Todd, walked out of a national outdoors retailer with all the equipment they needed for a backpacking trip – and an eye-popping receipt for $2,500.
That bothered her. A lot.
To Sarah, nature was a place for restoration and rejuvenation. She felt that everyone should be able to experience that – and the price of admission to the Great Outdoors, by her calculation, should be as close as possible to free.
Plenty of people have thoughts like these. But most people don’t have the ability, tenacity, or audacity to act on those ideas, much less see them through to completion.
in both the camping and patio categories, along with camping pillows, bug nets, and a whole bevy of hammock accessories.
ven a GED. According to standard career advice, those are minimum requirements for professional success. Sarah Douglass didn’t get that memo.
Her family went to Hawaii once — the only “real” vacation they ever took. Other than that, it was twice-yearly trips to the Strawberry Music Festival in Camp Mather near Yosemite. Families pitched tents or strung hammocks between the pines. There was folk and bluegrass music and jam sessions going all day and night. Kids roamed the woods and spent hours swimming and crafting. The whole experience ended with a Sunday revival at Birch Lake. For her, the festival was the pinnacle of childhood happiness; for her family, it also happened to be a vacation that was pretty close to free.
Around 18, Sarah briefly decided to try her hand at school again. She became pregnant. And that was that. She started a new chapter as a single parent, working 2 or 3 jobs at a time to raise her son. Of course, it was hard.
Sarah spent plenty of years working for other people. A pattern emerged. She’d learn the business until she could pretty much run the business, then she’d ask for a big raise, and walk if she didn’t get one. She walked a few times. She was good at working, liked working – it was the working “for other people” part that needed changing. Along the way, Sarah met her now-husband, Todd, who shared a similar set of values, including a desire to strike out and build a business they could call their own.
But hammocks were a no-fuss piece of equipment that represented happiness to Sarah. Within a few minutes, people could be set up, relaxing, and listening to the gurgle of a stream, ocean waves, or a breeze in the trees. Hammocks were a way to get people enjoying nature fast, easy, and on the cheap.
Hammocks, as a product, also had some clear business advantages: they were relatively simple to manufacture and their compact size made them economical to ship. The fabric color and style options were endless, so they could always be on trend as customer tastes changed. Plus, Wise Owl could produce a lot of hammock accessories to eventually expand its product line.
From the stitching thread counts to the way the seams felt on bare skin (after all, customers might be using a hammock while wearing shorts or a swimsuit), Sarah and Todd left no detail unexamined.
Of the low-cost models, none passed the Sarah test. Too scratchy, too small, poorly made, too difficult to set up. She found one she did love – but it came with a nearly $100 price tag.
They had a mission for their new Amazon ecommerce business: Make the greatest hammock anyone ever owned at half the price.
When she was dreaming up the Wise Owl brand, Sarah created a script for a video ad. In her storyboards, she would proffer a Wise Owl hammock toward the camera and explain to viewers that what she was holding in her hand was not in fact a hammock at all… but happiness. Wise Owl was selling the feeling she had in childhood, what she wanted everyone to experience themselves.
In 2015, Sarah and Todd drew down their savings to place her first purchase order of 200 hammocks. The day the products arrived on her doorstep was another lesson in the challenges of building an Amazon ecommerce business. She opened the box and … the Wise Owl logo was the wrong color. Even worse, the hammocks were stuffed into long and skinny carrying sacks. “They were basically two-foot-long sausages,” she says. She pulled them all apart and paid a local seamstress to fix every logo patch and every sack.
Today, Wise Owl is a booming online Amazon ecommerce business. The hammocks are nearing 40,000 ratings and maintain an impressive average of 4.8. Wise Owl has earned dual Best Seller Badges in both the camping hammocks and patio hammocks categories, while its camping pillows and hammock bug net also have Best Seller Badges. In 2021 alone, the brand sold hundreds of thousands of units in its product line. At the end of 2021, the Camping Hammock was capturing the majority of the market share for camping hammocks on Amazon.
hammocks will launch in the Canadian, UK, and German Amazon markets – a huge expansion for what started as a small Amazon ecommerce business.

https://www.thrasio.com/resources/blog/build-an-fba-brand
------------------------
Every company has growing pains. To maintain a healthy outlook for your brand's future, don't overlook these key action items.
To strengthen the health of your FBA brand, it can pay to look beyond the bottom line. Have you grown a solid base of happy repeat customers? Or earned an avalanche of 5-star Amazon reviews for your products?  These are the kind of success markers that don’t directly appear on a profit and loss statement — but they can translate into higher customer lifetime value and a stronger FBA brand. In other words, to build an FBA brand with staying power, it helps to consider the big picture of your business.
Here are 4 strategies to think about.
If you’re used to thinking only about profit margin, you may want to start thinking about profit-dollars as well. Your goal should be to improve conversion rates and sales velocity on the products that provide the most bang for the buck in profit-dollars.
Conversion share is the number of times customers bought your product after searching with a given keyword, divided by the total number of times customers bought any product after searching with that same keyword. You want this number to grow over time. It shows you’re capturing a bigger slice of the pie linked to keywords associated with your product.
. The report is a gold mine of insights about your category and your FBA business.
to see which images perform best.
And yes, go for the video. A lot of people don’t incorporate video because it seems too hard or complex. Think of this: we’ve made very professional marketing videos with celebrities that have cost tens of thousands of dollars – and in some scenarios, those convert less than something made in 20 minutes on an iPhone. The lesson? It doesn’t have to be an insane production to be successful. It just needs to connect with customers.
Reviews are the lifeblood of an Amazon ecommerce business. You know this. When faced with an array of similar products, customers often default to the one with the most positive reviews. High-quality reviews start with a high-quality product, of course, but after that, you’ll need to do a little more work to earn your stars.
The work is well worth it. You want to create a moat of positive reviews around your products – an unbridgeable gap between your well-loved products and those of your closest competitors. And to increase your volume of positive reviews, you’ll need to increase your volume of sales. This may mean selling at a loss via a temporary price cut, running Amazon Deals, or increasing ad spending to boost traffic.

Lifelong Online’s co-founders built a powerhouse brand that put a dent in India’s appliance market. The secret to their success? Listen to who matters most – the customer.
market for ecommerce businesses. To be successful, brands must navigate the complexities of India’s delivery infrastructure. They also need to understand the diverse needs of Indian customers, what they want, how they shop, and what they value. In a country of 1.4 billion people, that is extraordinarily difficult.
Which is why the team charged with leading Thrasio’s foray into India are people who know what it takes to build a successful ecommerce brand there.
“It’s our customers, their stories, and their experiences with our products that really inspire me,” says Bharat Kalia, one the three co-founders and CEO of Lifelong Online (now called Lifelong, a Thrasio Company).
Kalia founded Lifelong in 2015 with two partners – Atul Raheja and Varun Grover. Since then, they’ve created more than 100 products, primarily in the kitchen-and-home, and health-and-fitness categories. Air fryers, stoves, stand mixers, treadmills, massagers, hair straighteners: a Lifelong product can be found in about a million homes in more than 500 cities.
The three founders of India-based company Lifelong, a Thrasio company.
But perhaps its biggest triumph is how Lifelong boldly entered the appliance market – a notoriously difficult category dominated by large, entrenched brands. “The products I was using in my home were the same my parents used,” Kalia says.
can be tucked behind a couch or under a bed – the ultimate solution for health-conscious Indians living in space-challenged homes. Today it is one of the best-selling products in the Lifelong line.
Or consider the case of Lifelong’s early version bicycle. Customers were frustrated with how much time and effort it took to put together. “People were saying ‘This is the hardest thing I ever did,’” Kalia says. The next version had just 5 moving parts and came 90% pre-assembled. Now they’re on version 3.
The customer is both king and queen at Lifelong.
A new product launch can involve 2 or 3 interactions with customers in a month, conversations that are coded and analyzed to ensure products are delivering happiness and satisfaction. “We analyze a ton of data and carefully codify our questions before making customer calls,” Kalia says.
This extraordinary openness to feedback goes back to Lifelong’s very first product, an oven toaster griller. In their enthusiasm, Kalia and the founders mounted a product listing before the product was actually ready. “We were super happy to get our first order,” Kalia says. “The problem was we only had a prototype.” He gave the customer a heads-up that the product was a bit of a work in progress – and then packed it up and mailed it across the country to the customer.
in less than prime condition. (“Basically, it was mangled,” Kalia says.) After multiple calls with the customer, Kalia delivered a new model to the customer within 2 weeks. After all that, the customer left Lifelong a positive review.
Lifelong’s employees hard at work building a next generation consumer goods company in India. Thrasio bought a majority share in Lifelong in January.
Lifelong’s goal of reaching every household in a country of 1.4 billion people will require keeping a careful eye on how the market is changing. People aren’t as tied to legacy brands as they once were, Kalia says, and younger generations are more comfortable with ecommerce.

, your gateway to building a better consumer goods company. Every edition, we’ll share stories, insights, and expertise on a topic critical to the industry. This issue: the importance of quality assurance and making sure the products you deliver truly deliver.
Your customers expect the best. Here are 5 steps to build a strong quality assurance program and become more effective at preventing the defective.
Everyone’s been there. You buy a product that you’re excited to use, and then, when you need it, it fails to live up to its claims. Total headache. But for a business owner, one defective item can potentially set off a torrent of torment: a batch that has to be recalled, poor reviews that affect customer acquisition and loyalty, and even additional rounds of production. Fortunately, a strong quality assurance program can save the day, catching defective products before they ever ship to your customers.
If you don’t have a program in place, fear not: Axel Gonzalez has your back. Thrasio’s senior director of quality assurance and sustainability shares 5 steps to get you started.
Take, for example, the premium 10-piece bartender set Thrasio sells through our Mixology & Craft brand. It’s a showpiece with a premium price point. As such, its form can’t have scratches, dirty marks, or any flaws in its shape. Its strainer has to snugly fit inside the shaker so that no liquid leaks, while each piece must also fit in the display stand. And in order to meet Mixology & Craft’s goal of creating delicious cocktails, the shakers need to function as closed vessels that allow you to quickly mix ingredients together while simultaneously chilling the drink. This bartender set needs to bring your dreams of perfect libations to life.
Take some time to think about how form, fit, and function apply to your products. Literally make a list. This is the start of your quality assurance program, how you’ll begin to understand which attributes need to be assessed and tested. Depending on the complexity of your product, it could be a long list. But by clearly identifying what really matters to your products early on, you’ll set yourself up for a smooth operation and strong defense against trouble down the road.
Once you’ve decided what you’re going to test for, you need a resource to guide you through the process. Enter the quality acceptance document.
“The quality acceptance document is essentially the playbook that you will use to carry out your product inspections,” Gonzalez notes.
Picture a playbook for an NFL team. At its most basic, you’ll have your coaching staff and players (or, who’s leading and conducting the testing process), your schedule (how often you test), and your gameplan (how you’ll conduct tests). Instead of using Xs and Os and other visual aids to run your plays, however, you’ll use pictures that help you tell which products will pass a quality check, which will fail, and why. The playbook will also outline the sample sizes you’ll test and define what percentage of defective products will signal the need to reject a whole batch.
Use your written explanation of ideal form, fit, and function to identify what imperfections to test for. These will fall into 1 of 3 categories: minor defect, major defect, or critical defect. For example, a scratch on a cocktail shaker might be considered a minor defect, while a warped shaker that doesn’t fit inside the other shaker could be deemed a critical defect. The amount of defects you find in your sample size will give you an idea about whether you can ship your products, need to do additional testing, or have to – sigh – reject the batch outright.
You can then come up with your own sample sizes and rejection thresholds, but the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) also has a standardized acceptance quality limit (AQL) sampling system for inspection by attributes. The AQL chart can be used to provide information and guidance on inspection levels, rejection thresholds, and sample sizes for individual shipments.
If this seems like a lot, it doesn’t have to be. You don’t want to go it alone when creating a quality acceptance document. Incorporate your supplier into the process.
“It only makes sense that your supplier agrees to everything in the document so that both parties are on the same page in terms of what is and is not acceptable,” Gonzalez says.
By having quality standards clearly laid out and agreed upon ahead of time, you reduce the risk of having a drawn-out dispute with your supplier over an unsatisfactory batch of product.
Striking the right balance on quality assurance can also be tricky. You have to take a bit of a Goldilocks approach with it. Too strict and you run the risk of rejecting too much product, which can lead to delays and stockouts. Too lax and defective products can end up making their way to customers, paving the way for negative reviews. Knowing early on what is realistic for your supplier to achieve from a quality standpoint can save you a lot of time and money down the road.
Oh … and if you’ve never built a quality acceptance document before, no problem.
Templates to help structure your document are available online.
Gonzalez strongly advises against relying on your manufacturer to carry out product inspections on your behalf. “You want an impartial inspector,” he says. “You need to insist on it. Otherwise, you can be left with a supplier who cuts corners when it comes to quality assurance in the hopes of avoiding rejects.” But, Gonzalez adds, there are a few things to keep in mind when looking for a solid third-party inspection company to partner with.
Third-party inspection companies need to be available on short notice. Our partner promises to have an agent on site and ready to conduct an inspection, anywhere in continental Asia, within 24 hours. This kind of flexibility is invaluable, as it minimizes delays across our vast network of suppliers. But even if you only have a few suppliers, if the past 2 years have taught us anything, it’s that unexpected delays and last-minute changes are a fact of life. Knowing that your third-party inspection company has the flexibility to swiftly react to these changes is a huge value-add.
Find an inspection company with top-notch technology platforms that allow you to quickly and easily access all of your inspection reports across your suppliers in real time. That’s especially helpful if you’ve got a lot of suppliers (and thus a lot of inspection reports).
Your third-party inspection company should be aligned with the material in your quality acceptance document. After all, they’ll be the ones carrying out the inspections. In their reports, data should be presented clearly and succinctly, allowing you to make quick, informed decisions on which products are ready to ship. A good inspection report will begin with a summary of the main findings, followed by detailed information to support those assessments. When vetting third-party inspection companies, it’s not a bad idea to ask them for sample reports to get a feel for how they present data.
Schedule inspections as soon as your products come off the line – the sooner the better. Why? That gives you time to course correct if there’s a problem. You don’t want to be caught with insufficient inventory because of extended retesting time frames or full-batch rejections.
There’s no “one size fits all” approach to quality assurance. Every product is unique. Even 2 sellers who sell a similar product may have different ideas about what quality testing should look like. And that’s OK. You’re taking steps that give your products the best chance to arrive on the doorsteps of your customers – exactly how they expect them to be.

We bring products people love to the world.
At Thrasio, we’re reimagining how to make the world’s most-loved products accessible to everyone. So we work with successful sellers, using a deep understanding of rankings, ratings, and reviews – plus supply chain and marketing smarts – to transform the art and science of commerce.
We now feel like stronger business owners because we have a solid model for structuring any future brands we build — and can count on Thrasio to have our backs at any time.
I love how quickly Thrasio can move, how fair they are with their valuation, and how well they aligned with our vision. I returned to Thrasio to sell my second and third businesses.
Thrasio was able to consistently keep revenue strong through 2020 despite the numerous manufacturing, logistic, fulfillment constraints so many sellers faced during COVID. I don’t doubt they handled the account better than I could have myself given the same challenges.
Take a page from Thrasio’s playbook.
Actually, take 50 pages.
Get our book on getting your business ready for sale.
We make sure every Thrasio product delivered to your door delivers. And not just once, but every time, helping you make the most of every moment. It’s how we’ve become one of Amazon’s top 5 sellers.
If you’re looking to sell your Amazon business, we’re excited to work together.

Während Thrasio expandiert, arbeiten wir hart daran, dass unser globales Bewusstsein noch schneller wächst. Unser Einfluss auf die Umwelt und die Gemeinden hilft uns bei der Entscheidungsfindung.
Im Rahmen unseres Programms für verantwortungsbewusste Beschaffung arbeiten wir mit dem weltweit führenden Wirtschaftsverband für offenen und nachhaltigen Handel amfori zusammen, um Instrumente und bewährte Verfahren zur Bewertung der sozialen Leistung unserer Lieferkette einzuführen. Die Lieferanten verpflichten sich, den amfori-Verhaltenskodex zu folgen, der 11 Grundsätze umfasst: von fairer Bezahlung bis zum Umweltschutz.
Im Rahmen unserer Initiative zur Nachhaltigkeit in der Lieferkette haben wir den Standard des Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol übernommen, um unsere Treibhausgasemissionen zu messen, zu verwalten und zu melden. Darüber hinaus haben wir uns mit Pathzero zusammengetan, um die GHG-Emissionen von Port-to-Port-Frachtgeschäften anhand der im Protokoll festgelegten Best Practices einzuschätzen.
Um die Gemeinschaften, in denen wir leben und arbeiten, zu stärken, haben wir bedeutsame, unterhaltsame und wirkungsvolle Mentoring- und philanthropische Möglichkeiten geschaffen.
Das Stipendium von Thrasio in Zusammenarbeit mit der Success Academy (SA) in Harlem bietet High-School-Schülern die Möglichkeit, von unseren Mitarbeitern zu lernen, wie man ein soziales Unternehmen von Grund auf recherchiert, aufbaut und erweitert. Stipendiaten arbeiten in Teams und werden nach mehreren Workshops mit Seed-Finanzierung belohnt, um in ihren Communitys mindestens ein akzeptables Produkt oder eine tragbare Dienstleistung zu starten. So wie Amazon es für kleine und mittlere Unternehmen (KMU) getan hat, hoffen wir auch, das Unternehmertum weiter zu demokratisieren, indem wir Studenten frühzeitig dazu inspirieren, ihr Potenzial als Unternehmer der Zukunft zu erkunden.
Mentorin bei BUILD zu sein, war eine sehr beeindruckende und aufschlussreiche Erfahrung. Es ist unglaublich zu sehen, mit welcher Leidenschaft ein Konzept in ein Produkt umgesetzt wird, auf das die Schüler stolz sind. Die Arbeit bei Thrasio gibt mir das Selbstvertrauen, diesen Studenten zu sagen, dass es eine Welt gibt, die ihren Unternehmergeist schätzt und ihre Lösungsfähigkeiten braucht.
Die Möglichkeit, meiner eigenen Mittelschule etwas zurückzugeben, war eine unglaubliche berufliche Leistung, die auch für mich persönlich sehr wichtig ist. Ich bin begeistert, dass ich in den Gemeinden, in denen ich aufgewachsen bin, etwas bewirken kann, und dass ich klugen jungen Köpfen neue Karrieremöglichkeiten eröffnen kann.
Wir ermutigen die Thrasher, unsere Politik der unbegrenzten bezahlten Freistellung zu nutzen und sich für die Themen einzusetzen, die ihnen am wichtigsten sind.
Machen Sie sich mit einer Gruppe positiver Menschen auf, die Zukunft zu gestalten.

Our leadership team is made up of Amazon veterans, e-commerce connoisseurs and successful entrepreneurs who are at the forefront of rethinking the way products are brought to the world.
Wer wagt, gewinnt. Josh Silberstein und Carlos Cashman verkörpern dieses Motto. Die beiden Thrasio Gründer trafen sich bei der Arbeit an einer Kampagne für die Schmuckmarke Bravelets von Stephanie Fox, die heute COO bei Thrasio ist. Trotz anfänglichen Erfolgen konnte die Marke aufgrund von externen Faktoren und mangelnden Ressourcen jedoch nie ihr volles Potenzial entfalten. Das brachte das Team auf eine Idee: Könnte man angeschlagene E-Commerce-Shops aufkaufen und diese mit Hilfe von skalierbaren Prozessen in die nächste Liga befördern? Gemeinsam wagten sie sich auf ein völlig neues Terrain vor. Dabei haben sie nicht nur den Amazon-Markt für Dritt-Anbieter aufgemischt, sondern eine komplett neue Branche geschaffen, deren Erfolg hunderte von Wettbewerbern hervorgebracht hat.

As Thrasio expands across the world, we are committed to growing our global consciousness even faster. Our impact on the environment and the opportunity to lift people up help guide every decision we make.
Through our Responsible Sourcing Program, we partner with amfori, the leading global business association for open and sustainable trade, to implement tools and best practices that evaluate the social performance of our supply chain. Suppliers are committed to follow the amfori code of conduct – 11 principles ranging from fair payments to environmental protection.
As part of our Supply Chain Sustainability initiative, we’ve adopted the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol standard to measure, manage, and report our GHG emissions. We've also partnered with Pathzero to estimate GHG emissions from port-to-port freight operations, following best practices as specified in the Protocol.
To strengthen the communities in which we live and work, we’ve created meaningful, fun, and high-engagement mentorship and philanthropic opportunities.
Thrasio’s fellowship in collaboration with Success Academy (SA) in Harlem offers high school students the opportunity to learn from our employees how to research, build, and scale a social enterprise from scratch. Fellows work in teams and, after a series of workshops, are awarded seed funding to launch a minimum viable product or service in their communities. As Amazon has done for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), we also hope to further democratize entrepreneurship by inspiring students early on to explore their potential as the entrepreneurs of the future.
Being a mentor at BUILD has been a very humbling and eye-opening experience. It is incredible to see the passion that goes into developing a concept into a product that the students are proud of. Working at Thrasio gives me the confidence to tell these students that there is a world that values their entrepreneurial spirits and needs their problem-solving skills.
Being able to give back to my own middle school was an incredible professional accomplishment that’s also very important to me personally. I’m thrilled to be able to impact the communities where I grew up and to potentially introduce new career possibilities for bright young minds.
We encourage Thrashers to utilize our unlimited paid time off policy and take action on issues that are most meaningful to them.
Take off with a group of positive people out to define the future.

Our expert leadership team includes Amazon veterans, ecommerce mavens, and successful entrepreneurs at the forefront of rethinking how goods are brought to the world.
Some say fortune favors the brave. Josh and Carlos’ good fortune started when they met while working on a purpose-driven jewelry brand called Bravelets, founded by current Thrasio COO Stephanie Fox. Though the company was initially successful, environmental factors and a lack of resources kept it from growing to its maximum potential. This gave them an idea: What if they could roll up struggling ecommerce companies into one portfolio and use a single set of operators and scalable processes to take them to the next level? Talk about entering a brave new world. Together, they disrupted the 3P marketplace on Amazon and established a category that has gone on to inspire hundreds of competitors.

We bring products people love to the world.
At Thrasio, we’re reimagining how to make the world’s most-loved products accessible to everyone. So we work with successful sellers, using a deep understanding of rankings, ratings, and reviews – plus supply chain and marketing smarts – to transform the art and science of commerce.
We now feel like stronger business owners because we have a solid model for structuring any future brands we build—and can count on Thrasio to have our backs at any time.
I love how quickly Thrasio can move, how fair they are with their valuation, and how well they aligned with our vision. I returned to Thrasio to sell my second and third businesses.
Thrasio was able to consistently keep revenue strong through 2020 despite the numerous manufacturing, logistic, fulfillment constraints so many sellers faced during COVID. I don’t doubt they handled the account better than I could have myself given the same challenges.
Take a page from Thrasio’s playbook.
Actually, take 50 pages.

We make sure every Thrasio product delivered to your door delivers. And not just once, but every time, helping you make the most of every moment. It’s how we’ve become one of Amazon’s top 5 sellers.

Während Thrasio expandiert, arbeiten wir hart daran, dass unser globales Bewusstsein noch schneller wächst. Unser Einfluss auf die Umwelt und die Gemeinden hilft uns bei der Entscheidungsfindung.
Im Rahmen unseres Programms für verantwortungsbewusste Beschaffung arbeiten wir mit dem weltweit führenden Wirtschaftsverband für offenen und nachhaltigen Handel amfori zusammen, um Instrumente und bewährte Verfahren zur Bewertung der sozialen Leistung unserer Lieferkette einzuführen. Die Lieferanten verpflichten sich, den amfori-Verhaltenskodex zu folgen, der 11 Grundsätze umfasst: von fairer Bezahlung bis zum Umweltschutz.
Im Rahmen unserer Initiative zur Nachhaltigkeit in der Lieferkette haben wir den Standard des Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol übernommen, um unsere Treibhausgasemissionen zu messen, zu verwalten und zu melden. Darüber hinaus haben wir uns mit Pathzero zusammengetan, um die GHG-Emissionen von Port-to-Port-Frachtgeschäften anhand der im Protokoll festgelegten Best Practices einzuschätzen.
Um die Gemeinschaften, in denen wir leben und arbeiten, zu stärken, haben wir bedeutsame, unterhaltsame und wirkungsvolle Mentoring- und philanthropische Möglichkeiten geschaffen.
Das Stipendium von Thrasio in Zusammenarbeit mit der Success Academy (SA) in Harlem bietet High-School-Schülern die Möglichkeit, von unseren Mitarbeitern zu lernen, wie man ein soziales Unternehmen von Grund auf recherchiert, aufbaut und erweitert. Stipendiaten arbeiten in Teams und werden nach mehreren Workshops mit Seed-Finanzierung belohnt, um in ihren Communitys mindestens ein akzeptables Produkt oder eine tragbare Dienstleistung zu starten. So wie Amazon es für kleine und mittlere Unternehmen (KMU) getan hat, hoffen wir auch, das Unternehmertum weiter zu demokratisieren, indem wir Studenten frühzeitig dazu inspirieren, ihr Potenzial als Unternehmer der Zukunft zu erkunden.
Mentorin bei BUILD zu sein, war eine sehr beeindruckende und aufschlussreiche Erfahrung. Es ist unglaublich zu sehen, mit welcher Leidenschaft ein Konzept in ein Produkt umgesetzt wird, auf das die Schüler stolz sind. Die Arbeit bei Thrasio gibt mir das Selbstvertrauen, diesen Studenten zu sagen, dass es eine Welt gibt, die ihren Unternehmergeist schätzt und ihre Lösungsfähigkeiten braucht.
Die Möglichkeit, meiner eigenen Mittelschule etwas zurückzugeben, war eine unglaubliche berufliche Leistung, die auch für mich persönlich sehr wichtig ist. Ich bin begeistert, dass ich in den Gemeinden, in denen ich aufgewachsen bin, etwas bewirken kann, und dass ich klugen jungen Köpfen neue Karrieremöglichkeiten eröffnen kann.
Wir ermutigen die Thrasher, unsere Politik der unbegrenzten bezahlten Freistellung zu nutzen und sich für die Themen einzusetzen, die ihnen am wichtigsten sind.
Machen Sie sich mit einer Gruppe positiver Menschen auf, die Zukunft zu gestalten.

Fellows work in teams and, after a series of workshops, are awarded seed funding to launch a minimum viable product or service in their communities. As Amazon has done for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), we also hope to further democratize entrepreneurship by inspiring students early on to explore their potential as the entrepreneurs of the future.
Being a mentor at BUILD has been a very humbling and eye-opening experience. It is incredible to see the passion that goes into developing a concept into a product that the students are proud of. Working at Thrasio gives me the confidence to tell these students that there is a world that values their entrepreneurial spirits and needs their problem-solving skills.
Being able to give back to my own middle school was an incredible professional accomplishment that’s also very important to me personally. I’m thrilled to be able to impact the communities where I grew up and to potentially introduce new career possibilities for bright young minds.

Our leadership team is made up of Amazon veterans, e-commerce connoisseurs and successful entrepreneurs who are at the forefront of rethinking the way products are brought to the world.
Wer wagt, gewinnt. Josh Silberstein und Carlos Cashman verkörpern dieses Motto. Die beiden Thrasio Gründer trafen sich bei der Arbeit an einer Kampagne für die Schmuckmarke Bravelets von Stephanie Fox, die heute COO bei Thrasio ist. Trotz anfänglichen Erfolgen konnte die Marke aufgrund von externen Faktoren und mangelnden Ressourcen jedoch nie ihr volles Potenzial entfalten. Das brachte das Team auf eine Idee: Könnte man angeschlagene E-Commerce-Shops aufkaufen und diese mit Hilfe von skalierbaren Prozessen in die nächste Liga befördern? Gemeinsam wagten sie sich auf ein völlig neues Terrain vor. Dabei haben sie nicht nur den Amazon-Markt für Dritt-Anbieter aufgemischt, sondern eine komplett neue Branche geschaffen, deren Erfolg hunderte von Wettbewerbern hervorgebracht hat.

Three of our brand owners share hot takes and takeaways after logging huge sales during Amazon’s fall event.
from Amazon’s Prime Early Access Sale (“PEAS”) is revealing that the products with big sales didn’t come with big price tags. For Thrasio, this meant the event and many of our brands went together like PEAS and carrots, with several of those brands having their best days yet.
In our new Q&A series “Best in Thras,” we teased out some reflections on PEAS with three questions for three Thrashers whose brands cooked the competition.
. It snatched a top spot in Lightning Deals and reached #2 best-seller status in pet supplies.
136,440 hours of colorful dancing flames keeping customers warm this winter.
™ glow-in-the-dark basketballs, footballs, and soccer balls. All three products simultaneously held the #1 best-seller spot during the sale, and the brand absolutely crushed it with sales 1,000% bigger than July’s Prime Day, for its biggest Prime Day yet.
Why was your brand successful during this event?
Choosing an attractive price point for our customers helps a lot.
In addition, we were able to obtain a lot of affiliate assistance for external traffic while leveraging coupons.
: We ran three Lightning Deals on the top Magical Flames listings, stacking them with coupons and exclusive discounts for affiliate/influencer partners, to create attractive final price points for our customers across all pack sizes. Additionally, leading into PEAS, we launched 600+ new Amazon PPC campaigns, which drove rank and sessions on key upper funnel keywords.
: We leaned into the available Amazon promotions, ran analysis of deals on those promotional prices, and had great discounts at a great time of year. Soccer, football and basketball seasons are all starting, it’s getting darker outside earlier and GlowCity is a great gift for the holidays.
How will you extend and/or learn from that success to have a strong Turkey 5?
: We will continue to push for brand recognition off of Amazon by working with affiliates, running Facebook ads, and leveraging TikTok – as well as YouTube soon.
for conversions and brand recognition while running a Top Deal. We are also making sure we are positioned with enough inventory to sell through November, December, and deals.
: Given the historical “stocking stuffer” appeal for Magical Flames, we will lean heavily into this theme heading into T5 via strategic copy updates, paid traffic campaigns, and affiliate/influencer coverage. Improving brand exposure for Magical Flames on these search terms will enable our Turkey 5 Lightning Deals to reach a larger set of customers. Furthermore, we will look beyond Turkey 5 to continue offering attractive deals up until the Christmas delivery cutoff.
: Inventory is not unlimited, so we’ll set specific deal unit limits to maintain healthy inventory throughout Q4.
On T5, a deal can really take off, which is great. But you want to make sure you leave inventory to capture higher margin sales from the “halo” effect of deals. On GlowCity, our sales were up nearly 100 percent the week following PEAS compared to the week before.
What piece of advice would you give to sellers coming out of PEAS?
: Leverage coupons and price your product to sell during high traffic events. Then ride the algorithm spike wave at a higher price point.
: Do not undersell the power of deal and coupon stacking when trying to improve your deals page placement. Stacked coupons may not be visible on the deals page, but they positively impact conversion, which bodes well with Amazon’s ranking algorithm.
: Nothing too extraordinary here; run some final optimization tests over the next few weeks (creative, copy, etc.), work to have strong keyword rank the week leading into T5, and utilize the promotions Amazon offers. Choose the promotions that match the goals for your products – promotions have varying discounts and expected lifts.

------------------------
External traffic is critical to boosting sales and revenue from your Amazon listings. Measuring its performance is simple with this solution.
Rising PPC costs. Shifting consumer behavior. Increased competition. Just when you think you’ve got a handle on the best marketing strategy to drive sales to your Amazon FBA business, a new challenge pops up like some twisted game of Whac-A-Mole. That’s why it’s never been more important to have a comprehensive strategy that meets consumers wherever they are and is capable of handling new tests and surprises.
or preparing to sell, this tool will make your marketing efforts more fruitful and possibly increase the valuation of your company.
What is Amazon Attribution?
. Amazon Attribution is a solution created by Amazon to serve a similar need: the measurement of marketing channel performance on your site; in this case, that refers to non-Amazon marketing channel performance on your Amazon listing.
As you might know, advertisers are unable to place tracking pixels on their Amazon listings – so this tool is key to tracking your marketing performance. While still in beta, Amazon Attribution has been around for some time. It allows you to append URL parameters to your ads and pass information like campaign, ad group, channel, and publisher to the attribution console. This allows you to measure detailed product views (DPVs), add to carts (ATCs), units sold, total revenue, and more from your external traffic campaigns.
In addition to informing better ad spend decisions, Amazon Attribution ensures you have line of sight into conversions, which are paramount to ranking well in organic Amazon searches. Driving too much non-converting traffic to your listing risks hurting your Amazon SEO performance. In addition, advertisers receive a referral bonus from Amazon for every sale they generate via Amazon Attribution (more on this later).
.
From here you have two options: create the campaign manually or upload a file to create in bulk.
We recommend leveraging the bulk file creation flow if you’re starting with a paid search campaign. If you’re testing a paid social campaign you can use the manual creation flow.
Once you have the template you’ll want to create your campaign in the Google Ads editor and post it to Google/Bing as paused. From there you’ll need to download your keywords from Google and input the data into the bulk upload template columns below. Next, add the products you’d like to track in the products section.
Once the final URL suffix is added you’re ready to launch your campaign! There are also third-party tools that automate this process, but the manual flow is a great place to start if you’re using attribution for the first time.
As with any marketing tool, Amazon Attribution does have limitations. It’s important to note that once a campaign is launched it takes two full days for sales data to backfill completely. Because of this, we recommend ramping up campaigns gradually so you can optimize based on conversion data before really scaling up.
Amazon Attribution also uses a last-click attribution model with a 14-day look-back window. This model gives full credit for a sale or conversion to the touchpoint a customer last clicked on or engaged with before making a purchase. This is critical to keep in mind when analyzing campaign performance, because single-touch attribution models only tell part of the story.
Finally, to maintain user privacy Amazon masks conversion data for keywords that have not met the required daily click threshold. The banner below will indicate if you’re experiencing conversion masking in your campaigns.
This click threshold is cumulative, which means that viewing conversion data at the campaign level will provide the most accurate conversion amount for your campaigns. The click threshold is small but must be met for conversion data to appear. Conversions will not show at the ad group level if the particular ad group has not met that daily click threshold.
. On average, brands can earn a 10 percent bonus from qualifying sales simply by signing up. To calculate how much you may receive, multiply your qualifying sales from the relevant product category by the corresponding minimum bonus rate in the table below. Amazon now includes this amount in the reporting section of Attribution.
There is a two-month waiting period to receive the credit to your account, which accommodates order cancellations and customer returns. This bonus can really add up over time: one of our products, for example, generated $60k in referral bonus money over a seven-month period. The cherry on top? The bonus money also helps make leveraging external traffic easier for low-margin products.
Amazon Attribution is an easy tool to learn and a powerful way to keep growing your FBA business. The time you put into using it will easily pay off in the long run. Whether you’re currently running external campaigns or are planning to in the future, make sure to use it to track your sales.

sold worldwide and $3 billion spent on products from third-party small businesses. Many brands on the marketplace killed it, even if the macroeconomic uncertainty had some questioning their early strategy and decision-making. Now Amazon’s gearing up for another Prime Day in October – so, can lightning (deals) strike twice?
On Wednesday, Sept. 28, in the first episode of our new webinar series “For Your Own Goods,” three of Thrasio’s brand owners will help you prepare for another epic Amazon “holiday,” sharing insights from the successes they saw in July and advice on how your company can prepare for the sequel – or ride the wave and set the table for the Turkey 5.
We know what you’re thinking: Can you help me up my turkey game before November?
Scratch that: How will this webinar be different from the rest?
Host Sabina Raja, who shepherds the Zober brand of our YH Goods product line, will lead a conversation covering a wide range of topics with fellow brand owners Corey Gaarn and Will Moffett.
pillows over this summer’s event, Gaarn was instrumental to the bedding brand attaining 474% YOY sales growth, Amazon home page placement, and several editorial endorsements. The ChomChom pet hair roller, meanwhile, was also on the home page as a No. 1 trending deal and overall leader in the pet category, thanks to the work of Moffett and team members. They each bring a wealth of tactical knowledge on how to optimize your operations and sell at scale.
Sellers, come prepared to take notes and ask questions, because this discussion will hit on a number of learnings and key takeaways that can either be used over the next couple weeks or as part of a longer-term gameplan.
from 2-3 p.m. EDT Sept. 28 for this inaugural webinar and experience a taste of what’s in store “For Your Own Goods.” Our series will feature both internal Thrasio team members and external sellers talking about timely topics, providing advice on how to pivot when challenges arise, and breaking down the best long-term plans to grow your brand.

https://www.thrasio.com/resources/blog/secrets-to-omnichannel-and-retail
------------------------
Reeling in ecommerce sales takes skill. But to tackle new markets, you need new tools in your box. Our sales chief helps you cast a wider net.
Your megahit coffee frother nabbed the Amazon Best Seller Badge moooonths ago. In fact, your whole line of coffee products are buzzworthy category leaders. Revenue is up and so are your margins. Impressive? You bet. But your growth doesn’t have to stop there.
For businesses at the peak of their Amazon game, the next step is brewing up a strong omnichannel strategy.
What is omnichannel?
People often use the term “omnichannel” when they’re simply selling products through multiple marketplaces and channels – Amazon, direct to consumer (DTC), retail, and maybe social commerce. But the endgame for a true omnichannel strategy is complete integration, so that your markets, sales data, the customer experience, and the brand are all part of one intelligent ecosystem. Each piece plays a role in lifting the business and delivers a personalized experience to the customer.
notes that over 85% of shopping is still happening in physical stores.
Is your brand retail ready?
Your product has to be unique.
at a great price.
You need a gross profit margin of at least 50%.
Wholesaling can yield excellent gross margins – and more control over those margins. You set your price, and (in general) it sticks, which makes it different from selling through Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), says Esposito. “It’s not a daily battle to fix your price against your competitors’ pricing, which can lead you to a dangerous race to the bottom.” You’re also not paying FBA fees or pouring money into pay-per-click ads to get eyes on your product page. But you will be fulfilling your own wholesale orders and complying with unique terms associated with major retail. You’ll incur more operating costs due to shipping errors, product returns, payment terms, and many unique service requirements by retailer. So you’ve got to be able to maintain healthy profit margins before considering a run at retail.
Assume you’re going to sell your product to retailers at a wholesale price that is a 50% discount from your full FBA retail. Depending on the category of the product, that’s a good rule of thumb (also known as keystone pricing).
Do your research.
For certain categories, like cleaning supplies, there are more than a dozen national retailers that could sell your product. In other categories, like toys, you may only be able to place your product with three or four retailers – saturating your opportunities fairly quickly.
To test the waters, think about what kind of store you want your product to be in and why. What else is on the shelves in that store? What makes your product different from those other brands? What customers are you trying to reach? And why is your product going to make a difference in their lives?
The answers to these questions are going to guide your retail strategy – what stores you’re going after and how you’re going to craft your pitch to their buyers (but more on that later).
What are the drawbacks?
Supply chain is different for retail. You need to partner with a third-party logistics (3PL) company that can fulfill retail and have a systems infrastructure that connects you seamlessly to your 3PL and customer. You’ll be challenged to meet different compliance regulations or standards for both your products and packaging – and again, these challenges can and will differ by retailer. This may require legal advice or design expertise. Traditional retail triggers a fundamentally different operating structure than an FBA brand.
Managing supply chain and inventory is one of the biggest challenges of moving from FBA to an in-store environment. In retail in particular, stocking out is just not an option. Empty shelves are a retailer’s money-losing nightmare. If you miss orders, you could be hit with hefty chargebacks that could sink your brand, not to mention your reputation among buyers. If you become a headache for a buyer, you’ll lose their business for good.
In retail, people really do shop with their eyes first, which also means you need a great packaging designer who gets the voice of your brand and can make your product stand out on store shelves. The retail shopper is confronted by a sea of products and packaging, and you have a split second to attract their attention and highlight the uniqueness of your product!
So how do you get your products in front of buyers?
According to Esposito, there are a few ways you can get your foot in the door with retailers.
First, attend trade shows for your category. Say you’re in the pet category. Just start Googling “top pet retail trade shows,” find one that looks like it suits your product best, and sign up. You’ll meet a lot of mom and pop buyers, but you’ll also build your network and learn from other attendees. Esposito also recommends setting up an account on faire.com, which is like an Amazon for wholesalers.
Another approach would be to contact a manufacturer’s representative. Again, a Google search will bring up a number of experienced representatives who know the industry and have established relationships with the buyers you’re trying to get your product in front of. They tend to work on a 5% commission for major accounts, but the cost might be well worth the guidance they provide. You can also meet these reps at trade shows or through referrals.
Lastly, try good old-fashioned cold calling. If you have a successful “digitally native” brand and can tout a category leadership position with great reviews, most retail merchants will give you a look. Bombard them with samples and category knowledge and they may be your next best friend!
When an omnichannel strategy is firing on all cylinders, all the channels synergistically play a role in lifting overall sales and building brand equity. “We call it the flywheel effect,” says Esposito.
. The pet odor eliminator spray is on the shelves of many Target and PetSmart stores. Someone shopping for dog food in Target may see a bottle of Angry Orange pet odor eliminator and not initially buy it. But later, when they’re searching for pet odor eliminator products on their phone and Angry Orange appears with an average customer review rating of 4.4 out of 5 stars, the customer knows it’s a trusted brand. After they pull the trigger on a purchase, we can then retarget that customer for additional purchases of Angry Orange products through ads on Amazon and Google.
We first brought Angry Orange to a few hardware stores. Products flew off the shelves, and we were able to share that success as proof positive that Angry Orange could make money for other national retailers.
If you’re a top seller in your category, chances are you’ve got a great product. And getting that product into as many hands as possible means meeting customers where they are – on their computers, their phones, and yes – in brick-and-mortar stores too.

, Sarah Douglass, remembers the day that she and her husband, Todd, walked out of a national outdoors retailer with all the equipment they needed for a backpacking trip – and an eye-popping receipt for $2,500.
That bothered her. A lot.
To Sarah, nature was a place for restoration and rejuvenation. She felt that everyone should be able to experience that – and the price of admission to the Great Outdoors, by her calculation, should be as close as possible to free.
Plenty of people have thoughts like these. But most people don’t have the ability, tenacity, or audacity to act on those ideas, much less see them through to completion.
in both the camping and patio categories, along with camping pillows, bug nets, and a whole bevy of hammock accessories.
ven a GED. According to standard career advice, those are minimum requirements for professional success. Sarah Douglass didn’t get that memo.
Her family went to Hawaii once — the only “real” vacation they ever took. Other than that, it was twice-yearly trips to the Strawberry Music Festival in Camp Mather near Yosemite. Families pitched tents or strung hammocks between the pines. There was folk and bluegrass music and jam sessions going all day and night. Kids roamed the woods and spent hours swimming and crafting. The whole experience ended with a Sunday revival at Birch Lake. For her, the festival was the pinnacle of childhood happiness; for her family, it also happened to be a vacation that was pretty close to free.
Around 18, Sarah briefly decided to try her hand at school again. She became pregnant. And that was that. She started a new chapter as a single parent, working 2 or 3 jobs at a time to raise her son. Of course, it was hard.
Sarah spent plenty of years working for other people. A pattern emerged. She’d learn the business until she could pretty much run the business, then she’d ask for a big raise, and walk if she didn’t get one. She walked a few times. She was good at working, liked working – it was the working “for other people” part that needed changing. Along the way, Sarah met her now-husband, Todd, who shared a similar set of values, including a desire to strike out and build a business they could call their own.
But hammocks were a no-fuss piece of equipment that represented happiness to Sarah. Within a few minutes, people could be set up, relaxing, and listening to the gurgle of a stream, ocean waves, or a breeze in the trees. Hammocks were a way to get people enjoying nature fast, easy, and on the cheap.
Hammocks, as a product, also had some clear business advantages: they were relatively simple to manufacture and their compact size made them economical to ship. The fabric color and style options were endless, so they could always be on trend as customer tastes changed. Plus, Wise Owl could produce a lot of hammock accessories to eventually expand its product line.
From the stitching thread counts to the way the seams felt on bare skin (after all, customers might be using a hammock while wearing shorts or a swimsuit), Sarah and Todd left no detail unexamined.
Of the low-cost models, none passed the Sarah test. Too scratchy, too small, poorly made, too difficult to set up. She found one she did love – but it came with a nearly $100 price tag.
They had a mission for their new Amazon ecommerce business: Make the greatest hammock anyone ever owned at half the price.
When she was dreaming up the Wise Owl brand, Sarah created a script for a video ad. In her storyboards, she would proffer a Wise Owl hammock toward the camera and explain to viewers that what she was holding in her hand was not in fact a hammock at all… but happiness. Wise Owl was selling the feeling she had in childhood, what she wanted everyone to experience themselves.
In 2015, Sarah and Todd drew down their savings to place her first purchase order of 200 hammocks. The day the products arrived on her doorstep was another lesson in the challenges of building an Amazon ecommerce business. She opened the box and … the Wise Owl logo was the wrong color. Even worse, the hammocks were stuffed into long and skinny carrying sacks. “They were basically two-foot-long sausages,” she says. She pulled them all apart and paid a local seamstress to fix every logo patch and every sack.
Today, Wise Owl is a booming online Amazon ecommerce business. The hammocks are nearing 40,000 ratings and maintain an impressive average of 4.8. Wise Owl has earned dual Best Seller Badges in both the camping hammocks and patio hammocks categories, while its camping pillows and hammock bug net also have Best Seller Badges. In 2021 alone, the brand sold hundreds of thousands of units in its product line. At the end of 2021, the Camping Hammock was capturing the majority of the market share for camping hammocks on Amazon.
hammocks will launch in the Canadian, UK, and German Amazon markets – a huge expansion for what started as a small Amazon ecommerce business.
, but like many entrepreneurs, she’s not really one to… just rest.

------------------------
Every company has growing pains. To maintain a healthy outlook for your brand's future, don't overlook these key action items.
To strengthen the health of your FBA brand, it can pay to look beyond the bottom line. Have you grown a solid base of happy repeat customers? Or earned an avalanche of 5-star Amazon reviews for your products?  These are the kind of success markers that don’t directly appear on a profit and loss statement — but they can translate into higher customer lifetime value and a stronger FBA brand. In other words, to build an FBA brand with staying power, it helps to consider the big picture of your business.
Here are 4 strategies to think about.
If you’re used to thinking only about profit margin, you may want to start thinking about profit-dollars as well. Your goal should be to improve conversion rates and sales velocity on the products that provide the most bang for the buck in profit-dollars.
Conversion share is the number of times customers bought your product after searching with a given keyword, divided by the total number of times customers bought any product after searching with that same keyword. You want this number to grow over time. It shows you’re capturing a bigger slice of the pie linked to keywords associated with your product.
. The report is a gold mine of insights about your category and your FBA business.
to see which images perform best.
And yes, go for the video. A lot of people don’t incorporate video because it seems too hard or complex. Think of this: we’ve made very professional marketing videos with celebrities that have cost tens of thousands of dollars – and in some scenarios, those convert less than something made in 20 minutes on an iPhone. The lesson? It doesn’t have to be an insane production to be successful. It just needs to connect with customers.
Reviews are the lifeblood of an Amazon ecommerce business. You know this. When faced with an array of similar products, customers often default to the one with the most positive reviews. High-quality reviews start with a high-quality product, of course, but after that, you’ll need to do a little more work to earn your stars.
The work is well worth it. You want to create a moat of positive reviews around your products – an unbridgeable gap between your well-loved products and those of your closest competitors. And to increase your volume of positive reviews, you’ll need to increase your volume of sales. This may mean selling at a loss via a temporary price cut, running Amazon Deals, or increasing ad spending to boost traffic.

Lifelong Online’s co-founders built a powerhouse brand that put a dent in India’s appliance market. The secret to their success? Listen to who matters most – the customer.
market for ecommerce businesses. To be successful, brands must navigate the complexities of India’s delivery infrastructure. They also need to understand the diverse needs of Indian customers, what they want, how they shop, and what they value. In a country of 1.4 billion people, that is extraordinarily difficult.
Which is why the team charged with leading Thrasio’s foray into India are people who know what it takes to build a successful ecommerce brand there.
“It’s our customers, their stories, and their experiences with our products that really inspire me,” says Bharat Kalia, one the three co-founders and CEO of Lifelong Online (now called Lifelong, a Thrasio Company).
Kalia founded Lifelong in 2015 with two partners – Atul Raheja and Varun Grover. Since then, they’ve created more than 100 products, primarily in the kitchen-and-home, and health-and-fitness categories. Air fryers, stoves, stand mixers, treadmills, massagers, hair straighteners: a Lifelong product can be found in about a million homes in more than 500 cities.
The three founders of India-based company Lifelong, a Thrasio company.
But perhaps its biggest triumph is how Lifelong boldly entered the appliance market – a notoriously difficult category dominated by large, entrenched brands. “The products I was using in my home were the same my parents used,” Kalia says.
can be tucked behind a couch or under a bed – the ultimate solution for health-conscious Indians living in space-challenged homes. Today it is one of the best-selling products in the Lifelong line.
Or consider the case of Lifelong’s early version bicycle. Customers were frustrated with how much time and effort it took to put together. “People were saying ‘This is the hardest thing I ever did,’” Kalia says. The next version had just 5 moving parts and came 90% pre-assembled. Now they’re on version 3.
The customer is both king and queen at Lifelong.
A new product launch can involve 2 or 3 interactions with customers in a month, conversations that are coded and analyzed to ensure products are delivering happiness and satisfaction. “We analyze a ton of data and carefully codify our questions before making customer calls,” Kalia says.
This extraordinary openness to feedback goes back to Lifelong’s very first product, an oven toaster griller. In their enthusiasm, Kalia and the founders mounted a product listing before the product was actually ready. “We were super happy to get our first order,” Kalia says. “The problem was we only had a prototype.” He gave the customer a heads-up that the product was a bit of a work in progress – and then packed it up and mailed it across the country to the customer.
in less than prime condition. (“Basically, it was mangled,” Kalia says.) After multiple calls with the customer, Kalia delivered a new model to the customer within 2 weeks. After all that, the customer left Lifelong a positive review.
Lifelong’s employees hard at work building a next generation consumer goods company in India. Thrasio bought a majority share in Lifelong in January.
Lifelong’s goal of reaching every household in a country of 1.4 billion people will require keeping a careful eye on how the market is changing. People aren’t as tied to legacy brands as they once were, Kalia says, and younger generations are more comfortable with ecommerce.

, your gateway to building a better consumer goods company. Every edition, we’ll share stories, insights, and expertise on a topic critical to the industry. This issue: the importance of quality assurance and making sure the products you deliver truly deliver.
Your customers expect the best. Here are 5 steps to build a strong quality assurance program and become more effective at preventing the defective.
Everyone’s been there. You buy a product that you’re excited to use, and then, when you need it, it fails to live up to its claims. Total headache. But for a business owner, one defective item can potentially set off a torrent of torment: a batch that has to be recalled, poor reviews that affect customer acquisition and loyalty, and even additional rounds of production. Fortunately, a strong quality assurance program can save the day, catching defective products before they ever ship to your customers.
If you don’t have a program in place, fear not: Axel Gonzalez has your back. Thrasio’s senior director of quality assurance and sustainability shares 5 steps to get you started.
Take, for example, the premium 10-piece bartender set Thrasio sells through our Mixology & Craft brand. It’s a showpiece with a premium price point. As such, its form can’t have scratches, dirty marks, or any flaws in its shape. Its strainer has to snugly fit inside the shaker so that no liquid leaks, while each piece must also fit in the display stand. And in order to meet Mixology & Craft’s goal of creating delicious cocktails, the shakers need to function as closed vessels that allow you to quickly mix ingredients together while simultaneously chilling the drink. This bartender set needs to bring your dreams of perfect libations to life.
Take some time to think about how form, fit, and function apply to your products. Literally make a list. This is the start of your quality assurance program, how you’ll begin to understand which attributes need to be assessed and tested. Depending on the complexity of your product, it could be a long list. But by clearly identifying what really matters to your products early on, you’ll set yourself up for a smooth operation and strong defense against trouble down the road.
Once you’ve decided what you’re going to test for, you need a resource to guide you through the process. Enter the quality acceptance document.
“The quality acceptance document is essentially the playbook that you will use to carry out your product inspections,” Gonzalez notes.
Picture a playbook for an NFL team. At its most basic, you’ll have your coaching staff and players (or, who’s leading and conducting the testing process), your schedule (how often you test), and your gameplan (how you’ll conduct tests). Instead of using Xs and Os and other visual aids to run your plays, however, you’ll use pictures that help you tell which products will pass a quality check, which will fail, and why. The playbook will also outline the sample sizes you’ll test and define what percentage of defective products will signal the need to reject a whole batch.
Use your written explanation of ideal form, fit, and function to identify what imperfections to test for. These will fall into 1 of 3 categories: minor defect, major defect, or critical defect. For example, a scratch on a cocktail shaker might be considered a minor defect, while a warped shaker that doesn’t fit inside the other shaker could be deemed a critical defect. The amount of defects you find in your sample size will give you an idea about whether you can ship your products, need to do additional testing, or have to – sigh – reject the batch outright.
You can then come up with your own sample sizes and rejection thresholds, but the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) also has a standardized acceptance quality limit (AQL) sampling system for inspection by attributes. The AQL chart can be used to provide information and guidance on inspection levels, rejection thresholds, and sample sizes for individual shipments.
If this seems like a lot, it doesn’t have to be. You don’t want to go it alone when creating a quality acceptance document. Incorporate your supplier into the process.
“It only makes sense that your supplier agrees to everything in the document so that both parties are on the same page in terms of what is and is not acceptable,” Gonzalez says.
By having quality standards clearly laid out and agreed upon ahead of time, you reduce the risk of having a drawn-out dispute with your supplier over an unsatisfactory batch of product.
Striking the right balance on quality assurance can also be tricky. You have to take a bit of a Goldilocks approach with it. Too strict and you run the risk of rejecting too much product, which can lead to delays and stockouts. Too lax and defective products can end up making their way to customers, paving the way for negative reviews. Knowing early on what is realistic for your supplier to achieve from a quality standpoint can save you a lot of time and money down the road.
Oh … and if you’ve never built a quality acceptance document before, no problem.
Templates to help structure your document are available online.
Gonzalez strongly advises against relying on your manufacturer to carry out product inspections on your behalf. “You want an impartial inspector,” he says. “You need to insist on it. Otherwise, you can be left with a supplier who cuts corners when it comes to quality assurance in the hopes of avoiding rejects.” But, Gonzalez adds, there are a few things to keep in mind when looking for a solid third-party inspection company to partner with.
Third-party inspection companies need to be available on short notice. Our partner promises to have an agent on site and ready to conduct an inspection, anywhere in continental Asia, within 24 hours. This kind of flexibility is invaluable, as it minimizes delays across our vast network of suppliers. But even if you only have a few suppliers, if the past 2 years have taught us anything, it’s that unexpected delays and last-minute changes are a fact of life. Knowing that your third-party inspection company has the flexibility to swiftly react to these changes is a huge value-add.
Find an inspection company with top-notch technology platforms that allow you to quickly and easily access all of your inspection reports across your suppliers in real time. That’s especially helpful if you’ve got a lot of suppliers (and thus a lot of inspection reports).
Your third-party inspection company should be aligned with the material in your quality acceptance document. After all, they’ll be the ones carrying out the inspections. In their reports, data should be presented clearly and succinctly, allowing you to make quick, informed decisions on which products are ready to ship. A good inspection report will begin with a summary of the main findings, followed by detailed information to support those assessments. When vetting third-party inspection companies, it’s not a bad idea to ask them for sample reports to get a feel for how they present data.
Schedule inspections as soon as your products come off the line – the sooner the better. Why? That gives you time to course correct if there’s a problem. You don’t want to be caught with insufficient inventory because of extended retesting time frames or full-batch rejections.
There’s no “one size fits all” approach to quality assurance. Every product is unique. Even 2 sellers who sell a similar product may have different ideas about what quality testing should look like. And that’s OK. You’re taking steps that give your products the best chance to arrive on the doorsteps of your customers – exactly how they expect them to be.

Während Thrasio expandiert, arbeiten wir hart daran, dass unser globales Bewusstsein noch schneller wächst. Unser Einfluss auf die Umwelt und die Gemeinden hilft uns bei der Entscheidungsfindung.
Im Rahmen unseres Programms für verantwortungsbewusste Beschaffung arbeiten wir mit dem weltweit führenden Wirtschaftsverband für offenen und nachhaltigen Handel amfori zusammen, um Instrumente und bewährte Verfahren zur Bewertung der sozialen Leistung unserer Lieferkette einzuführen. Die Lieferanten verpflichten sich, den amfori-Verhaltenskodex zu folgen, der 11 Grundsätze umfasst: von fairer Bezahlung bis zum Umweltschutz.
Im Rahmen unserer Initiative zur Nachhaltigkeit in der Lieferkette haben wir den Standard des Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol übernommen, um unsere Treibhausgasemissionen zu messen, zu verwalten und zu melden. Darüber hinaus haben wir uns mit Pathzero zusammengetan, um die GHG-Emissionen von Port-to-Port-Frachtgeschäften anhand der im Protokoll festgelegten Best Practices einzuschätzen.
Um die Gemeinschaften, in denen wir leben und arbeiten, zu stärken, haben wir bedeutsame, unterhaltsame und wirkungsvolle Mentoring- und philanthropische Möglichkeiten geschaffen.
Das Stipendium von Thrasio in Zusammenarbeit mit der Success Academy (SA) in Harlem bietet High-School-Schülern die Möglichkeit, von unseren Mitarbeitern zu lernen, wie man ein soziales Unternehmen von Grund auf recherchiert, aufbaut und erweitert. Stipendiaten arbeiten in Teams und werden nach mehreren Workshops mit Seed-Finanzierung belohnt, um in ihren Communitys mindestens ein akzeptables Produkt oder eine tragbare Dienstleistung zu starten. So wie Amazon es für kleine und mittlere Unternehmen (KMU) getan hat, hoffen wir auch, das Unternehmertum weiter zu demokratisieren, indem wir Studenten frühzeitig dazu inspirieren, ihr Potenzial als Unternehmer der Zukunft zu erkunden.
Mentorin bei BUILD zu sein, war eine sehr beeindruckende und aufschlussreiche Erfahrung. Es ist unglaublich zu sehen, mit welcher Leidenschaft ein Konzept in ein Produkt umgesetzt wird, auf das die Schüler stolz sind. Die Arbeit bei Thrasio gibt mir das Selbstvertrauen, diesen Studenten zu sagen, dass es eine Welt gibt, die ihren Unternehmergeist schätzt und ihre Lösungsfähigkeiten braucht.
Die Möglichkeit, meiner eigenen Mittelschule etwas zurückzugeben, war eine unglaubliche berufliche Leistung, die auch für mich persönlich sehr wichtig ist. Ich bin begeistert, dass ich in den Gemeinden, in denen ich aufgewachsen bin, etwas bewirken kann, und dass ich klugen jungen Köpfen neue Karrieremöglichkeiten eröffnen kann.
Wir ermutigen die Thrasher, unsere Politik der unbegrenzten bezahlten Freistellung zu nutzen und sich für die Themen einzusetzen, die ihnen am wichtigsten sind.
Machen Sie sich mit einer Gruppe positiver Menschen auf, die Zukunft zu gestalten.

Our leadership team is made up of Amazon veterans, e-commerce connoisseurs and successful entrepreneurs who are at the forefront of rethinking the way products are brought to the world.
Wer wagt, gewinnt. Josh Silberstein und Carlos Cashman verkörpern dieses Motto. Die beiden Thrasio Gründer trafen sich bei der Arbeit an einer Kampagne für die Schmuckmarke Bravelets von Stephanie Fox, die heute COO bei Thrasio ist. Trotz anfänglichen Erfolgen konnte die Marke aufgrund von externen Faktoren und mangelnden Ressourcen jedoch nie ihr volles Potenzial entfalten. Das brachte das Team auf eine Idee: Könnte man angeschlagene E-Commerce-Shops aufkaufen und diese mit Hilfe von skalierbaren Prozessen in die nächste Liga befördern? Gemeinsam wagten sie sich auf ein völlig neues Terrain vor. Dabei haben sie nicht nur den Amazon-Markt für Dritt-Anbieter aufgemischt, sondern eine komplett neue Branche geschaffen, deren Erfolg hunderte von Wettbewerbern hervorgebracht hat.

We bring products people love to the world.
At Thrasio, we’re reimagining how to make the world’s most-loved products accessible to everyone. So we work with successful sellers, using a deep understanding of rankings, ratings, and reviews – plus supply chain and marketing smarts – to transform the art and science of commerce.
We now feel like stronger business owners because we have a solid model for structuring any future brands we build—and can count on Thrasio to have our backs at any time.
I love how quickly Thrasio can move, how fair they are with their valuation, and how well they aligned with our vision. I returned to Thrasio to sell my second and third businesses.
Thrasio was able to consistently keep revenue strong through 2020 despite the numerous manufacturing, logistic, fulfillment constraints so many sellers faced during COVID. I don’t doubt they handled the account better than I could have myself given the same challenges.
Take a page from Thrasio’s playbook.
Actually, take 50 pages.

We make sure every Thrasio product delivered to your door delivers. And not just once, but every time, helping you make the most of every moment. It’s how we’ve become one of Amazon’s top 5 sellers.

As Thrasio expands across the world, we are committed to growing our global consciousness even faster. Our impact on the environment and the opportunity to lift people up help guide every decision we make.
Through our Responsible Sourcing Program, we partner with amfori, the leading global business association for open and sustainable trade, to implement tools and best practices that evaluate the social performance of our supply chain. Suppliers are committed to follow the amfori code of conduct – 11 principles ranging from fair payments to environmental protection.
As part of our Supply Chain Sustainability initiative, we’ve adopted the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol standard to measure, manage, and report our GHG emissions. We've also partnered with Pathzero to estimate GHG emissions from port-to-port freight operations, following best practices as specified in the Protocol.
To strengthen the communities in which we live and work, we’ve created meaningful, fun, and high-engagement mentorship and philanthropic opportunities.
Thrasio’s fellowship in collaboration with Success Academy (SA) in Harlem offers high school students the opportunity to learn from our employees how to research, build, and scale a social enterprise from scratch. Fellows work in teams and, after a series of workshops, are awarded seed funding to launch a minimum viable product or service in their communities. As Amazon has done for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), we also hope to further democratize entrepreneurship by inspiring students early on to explore their potential as the entrepreneurs of the future.
Being a mentor at BUILD has been a very humbling and eye-opening experience. It is incredible to see the passion that goes into developing a concept into a product that the students are proud of. Working at Thrasio gives me the confidence to tell these students that there is a world that values their entrepreneurial spirits and needs their problem-solving skills.
Being able to give back to my own middle school was an incredible professional accomplishment that’s also very important to me personally. I’m thrilled to be able to impact the communities where I grew up and to potentially introduce new career possibilities for bright young minds.
We encourage Thrashers to utilize our unlimited paid time off policy and take action on issues that are most meaningful to them.
Take off with a group of positive people out to define the future.

Some say fortune favors the brave. Josh and Carlos’ good fortune started when they met while working on a purpose-driven jewelry brand called Bravelets, founded by current Thrasio COO Stephanie Fox. Though the company was initially successful, environmental factors and a lack of resources kept it from growing to its maximum potential. This gave them an idea: What if they could roll up struggling ecommerce companies into one portfolio and use a single set of operators and scalable processes to take them to the next level? Talk about entering a brave new world. Together, they disrupted the 3P marketplace on Amazon and established a category that has gone on to inspire hundreds of competitors.

Some say fortune favors the brave. Josh and Carlos’ good fortune started when they met while working on a purpose-driven jewelry brand called Bravelets, founded by current Thrasio COO Stephanie Fox. Though the company was initially successful, environmental factors and a lack of resources kept it from growing to its maximum potential. This gave them an idea: What if they could roll up struggling ecommerce companies into one portfolio and use a single set of operators and scalable processes to take them to the next level? Talk about entering a brave new world. Together, they disrupted the 3P marketplace on Amazon and established a category that has gone on to inspire hundreds of competitors.

Während Thrasio expandiert, arbeiten wir hart daran, dass unser globales Bewusstsein noch schneller wächst. Unser Einfluss auf die Umwelt und die Gemeinden hilft uns bei der Entscheidungsfindung.
Im Rahmen unseres Programms für verantwortungsbewusste Beschaffung arbeiten wir mit dem weltweit führenden Wirtschaftsverband für offenen und nachhaltigen Handel amfori zusammen, um Instrumente und bewährte Verfahren zur Bewertung der sozialen Leistung unserer Lieferkette einzuführen. Die Lieferanten verpflichten sich, den amfori-Verhaltenskodex zu folgen, der 11 Grundsätze umfasst: von fairer Bezahlung bis zum Umweltschutz.
Im Rahmen unserer Initiative zur Nachhaltigkeit in der Lieferkette haben wir den Standard des Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol übernommen, um unsere Treibhausgasemissionen zu messen, zu verwalten und zu melden. Darüber hinaus haben wir uns mit Pathzero zusammengetan, um die GHG-Emissionen von Port-to-Port-Frachtgeschäften anhand der im Protokoll festgelegten Best Practices einzuschätzen.
Um die Gemeinschaften, in denen wir leben und arbeiten, zu stärken, haben wir bedeutsame, unterhaltsame und wirkungsvolle Mentoring- und philanthropische Möglichkeiten geschaffen.
Das Stipendium von Thrasio in Zusammenarbeit mit der Success Academy (SA) in Harlem bietet High-School-Schülern die Möglichkeit, von unseren Mitarbeitern zu lernen, wie man ein soziales Unternehmen von Grund auf recherchiert, aufbaut und erweitert. Stipendiaten arbeiten in Teams und werden nach mehreren Workshops mit Seed-Finanzierung belohnt, um in ihren Communitys mindestens ein akzeptables Produkt oder eine tragbare Dienstleistung zu starten. So wie Amazon es für kleine und mittlere Unternehmen (KMU) getan hat, hoffen wir auch, das Unternehmertum weiter zu demokratisieren, indem wir Studenten frühzeitig dazu inspirieren, ihr Potenzial als Unternehmer der Zukunft zu erkunden.
Mentorin bei BUILD zu sein, war eine sehr beeindruckende und aufschlussreiche Erfahrung. Es ist unglaublich zu sehen, mit welcher Leidenschaft ein Konzept in ein Produkt umgesetzt wird, auf das die Schüler stolz sind. Die Arbeit bei Thrasio gibt mir das Selbstvertrauen, diesen Studenten zu sagen, dass es eine Welt gibt, die ihren Unternehmergeist schätzt und ihre Lösungsfähigkeiten braucht.
Die Möglichkeit, meiner eigenen Mittelschule etwas zurückzugeben, war eine unglaubliche berufliche Leistung, die auch für mich persönlich sehr wichtig ist. Ich bin begeistert, dass ich in den Gemeinden, in denen ich aufgewachsen bin, etwas bewirken kann, und dass ich klugen jungen Köpfen neue Karrieremöglichkeiten eröffnen kann.
Wir ermutigen die Thrasher, unsere Politik der unbegrenzten bezahlten Freistellung zu nutzen und sich für die Themen einzusetzen, die ihnen am wichtigsten sind.
Machen Sie sich mit einer Gruppe positiver Menschen auf, die Zukunft zu gestalten.

As Thrasio expands across the world, we are committed to growing our global consciousness even faster. Our impact on the environment and the opportunity to lift people up help guide every decision we make.
Through our Responsible Sourcing Program, we partner with amfori, the leading global business association for open and sustainable trade, to implement tools and best practices that evaluate the social performance of our supply chain. Suppliers are committed to follow the amfori code of conduct – 11 principles ranging from fair payments to environmental protection.
As part of our Supply Chain Sustainability initiative, we’ve adopted the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol standard to measure, manage, and report our GHG emissions. We've also partnered with Pathzero to estimate GHG emissions from port-to-port freight operations, following best practices as specified in the Protocol.
To strengthen the communities in which we live and work, we’ve created meaningful, fun, and high-engagement mentorship and philanthropic opportunities.
Thrasio’s fellowship in collaboration with Success Academy (SA) in Harlem offers high school students the opportunity to learn from our employees how to research, build, and scale a social enterprise from scratch. Fellows work in teams and, after a series of workshops, are awarded seed funding to launch a minimum viable product or service in their communities. As Amazon has done for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), we also hope to further democratize entrepreneurship by inspiring students early on to explore their potential as the entrepreneurs of the future.
Being a mentor at BUILD has been a very humbling and eye-opening experience. It is incredible to see the passion that goes into developing a concept into a product that the students are proud of. Working at Thrasio gives me the confidence to tell these students that there is a world that values their entrepreneurial spirits and needs their problem-solving skills.
Being able to give back to my own middle school was an incredible professional accomplishment that’s also very important to me personally. I’m thrilled to be able to impact the communities where I grew up and to potentially introduce new career possibilities for bright young minds.
We encourage Thrashers to utilize our unlimited paid time off policy and take action on issues that are most meaningful to them.
Take off with a group of positive people out to define the future.

Wer wagt, gewinnt. Josh Silberstein und Carlos Cashman verkörpern dieses Motto. Die beiden Thrasio Gründer trafen sich bei der Arbeit an einer Kampagne für die Schmuckmarke Bravelets von Stephanie Fox, die heute COO bei Thrasio ist. Trotz anfänglichen Erfolgen konnte die Marke aufgrund von externen Faktoren und mangelnden Ressourcen jedoch nie ihr volles Potenzial entfalten. Das brachte das Team auf eine Idee: Könnte man angeschlagene E-Commerce-Shops aufkaufen und diese mit Hilfe von skalierbaren Prozessen in die nächste Liga befördern? Gemeinsam wagten sie sich auf ein völlig neues Terrain vor. Dabei haben sie nicht nur den Amazon-Markt für Dritt-Anbieter aufgemischt, sondern eine komplett neue Branche geschaffen, deren Erfolg hunderte von Wettbewerbern hervorgebracht hat.

At Thrasio, we’re reimagining how to make the world’s most-loved products accessible to everyone. So we work with successful sellers, using a deep understanding of rankings, ratings, and reviews – plus supply chain and marketing smarts – to transform the art and science of commerce.
We now feel like stronger business owners because we have a solid model for structuring any future brands we build—and can count on Thrasio to have our backs at any time.
I love how quickly Thrasio can move, how fair they are with their valuation, and how well they aligned with our vision. I returned to Thrasio to sell my second and third businesses.
Thrasio was able to consistently keep revenue strong through 2020 despite the numerous manufacturing, logistic, fulfillment constraints so many sellers faced during COVID. I don’t doubt they handled the account better than I could have myself given the same challenges.
Take a page from Thrasio’s playbook.

Three of our brand owners share hot takes and takeaways after logging huge sales during Amazon’s fall event.
from Amazon’s Prime Early Access Sale (“PEAS”) is revealing that the products with big sales didn’t come with big price tags. For Thrasio, this meant the event and many of our brands went together like PEAS and carrots, with several of those brands having their best days yet.
In our new Q&A series “Best in Thras,” we teased out some reflections on PEAS with three questions for three Thrashers whose brands cooked the competition.
. It snatched a top spot in Lightning Deals and reached #2 best-seller status in pet supplies.
136,440 hours of colorful dancing flames keeping customers warm this winter.
™ glow-in-the-dark basketballs, footballs, and soccer balls. All three products simultaneously held the #1 best-seller spot during the sale, and the brand absolutely crushed it with sales 1,000% bigger than July’s Prime Day, for its biggest Prime Day yet.
Why was your brand successful during this event?
Choosing an attractive price point for our customers helps a lot.
In addition, we were able to obtain a lot of affiliate assistance for external traffic while leveraging coupons.
: We ran three Lightning Deals on the top Magical Flames listings, stacking them with coupons and exclusive discounts for affiliate/influencer partners, to create attractive final price points for our customers across all pack sizes. Additionally, leading into PEAS, we launched 600+ new Amazon PPC campaigns, which drove rank and sessions on key upper funnel keywords.
: We leaned into the available Amazon promotions, ran analysis of deals on those promotional prices, and had great discounts at a great time of year. Soccer, football and basketball seasons are all starting, it’s getting darker outside earlier and GlowCity is a great gift for the holidays.
How will you extend and/or learn from that success to have a strong Turkey 5?
: We will continue to push for brand recognition off of Amazon by working with affiliates, running Facebook ads, and leveraging TikTok – as well as YouTube soon.
for conversions and brand recognition while running a Top Deal. We are also making sure we are positioned with enough inventory to sell through November, December, and deals.
: Given the historical “stocking stuffer” appeal for Magical Flames, we will lean heavily into this theme heading into T5 via strategic copy updates, paid traffic campaigns, and affiliate/influencer coverage. Improving brand exposure for Magical Flames on these search terms will enable our Turkey 5 Lightning Deals to reach a larger set of customers. Furthermore, we will look beyond Turkey 5 to continue offering attractive deals up until the Christmas delivery cutoff.
: Inventory is not unlimited, so we’ll set specific deal unit limits to maintain healthy inventory throughout Q4.
On T5, a deal can really take off, which is great. But you want to make sure you leave inventory to capture higher margin sales from the “halo” effect of deals. On GlowCity, our sales were up nearly 100 percent the week following PEAS compared to the week before.
What piece of advice would you give to sellers coming out of PEAS?
: Leverage coupons and price your product to sell during high traffic events. Then ride the algorithm spike wave at a higher price point.
: Do not undersell the power of deal and coupon stacking when trying to improve your deals page placement. Stacked coupons may not be visible on the deals page, but they positively impact conversion, which bodes well with Amazon’s ranking algorithm.
: Nothing too extraordinary here; run some final optimization tests over the next few weeks (creative, copy, etc.), work to have strong keyword rank the week leading into T5, and utilize the promotions Amazon offers. Choose the promotions that match the goals for your products – promotions have varying discounts and expected lifts.

------------------------
External traffic is critical to boosting sales and revenue from your Amazon listings. Measuring its performance is simple with this solution.
Rising PPC costs. Shifting consumer behavior. Increased competition. Just when you think you’ve got a handle on the best marketing strategy to drive sales to your Amazon FBA business, a new challenge pops up like some twisted game of Whac-A-Mole. That’s why it’s never been more important to have a comprehensive strategy that meets consumers wherever they are and is capable of handling new tests and surprises.
or preparing to sell, this tool will make your marketing efforts more fruitful and possibly increase the valuation of your company.
What is Amazon Attribution?
. Amazon Attribution is a solution created by Amazon to serve a similar need: the measurement of marketing channel performance on your site; in this case, that refers to non-Amazon marketing channel performance on your Amazon listing.
As you might know, advertisers are unable to place tracking pixels on their Amazon listings – so this tool is key to tracking your marketing performance. While still in beta, Amazon Attribution has been around for some time. It allows you to append URL parameters to your ads and pass information like campaign, ad group, channel, and publisher to the attribution console. This allows you to measure detailed product views (DPVs), add to carts (ATCs), units sold, total revenue, and more from your external traffic campaigns.
In addition to informing better ad spend decisions, Amazon Attribution ensures you have line of sight into conversions, which are paramount to ranking well in organic Amazon searches. Driving too much non-converting traffic to your listing risks hurting your Amazon SEO performance. In addition, advertisers receive a referral bonus from Amazon for every sale they generate via Amazon Attribution (more on this later).
.
From here you have two options: create the campaign manually or upload a file to create in bulk.
We recommend leveraging the bulk file creation flow if you’re starting with a paid search campaign. If you’re testing a paid social campaign you can use the manual creation flow.
Once you have the template you’ll want to create your campaign in the Google Ads editor and post it to Google/Bing as paused. From there you’ll need to download your keywords from Google and input the data into the bulk upload template columns below. Next, add the products you’d like to track in the products section.
Once the final URL suffix is added you’re ready to launch your campaign! There are also third-party tools that automate this process, but the manual flow is a great place to start if you’re using attribution for the first time.
As with any marketing tool, Amazon Attribution does have limitations. It’s important to note that once a campaign is launched it takes two full days for sales data to backfill completely. Because of this, we recommend ramping up campaigns gradually so you can optimize based on conversion data before really scaling up.
Amazon Attribution also uses a last-click attribution model with a 14-day look-back window. This model gives full credit for a sale or conversion to the touchpoint a customer last clicked on or engaged with before making a purchase. This is critical to keep in mind when analyzing campaign performance, because single-touch attribution models only tell part of the story.
Finally, to maintain user privacy Amazon masks conversion data for keywords that have not met the required daily click threshold. The banner below will indicate if you’re experiencing conversion masking in your campaigns.
This click threshold is cumulative, which means that viewing conversion data at the campaign level will provide the most accurate conversion amount for your campaigns. The click threshold is small but must be met for conversion data to appear. Conversions will not show at the ad group level if the particular ad group has not met that daily click threshold.
. On average, brands can earn a 10 percent bonus from qualifying sales simply by signing up. To calculate how much you may receive, multiply your qualifying sales from the relevant product category by the corresponding minimum bonus rate in the table below. Amazon now includes this amount in the reporting section of Attribution.
There is a two-month waiting period to receive the credit to your account, which accommodates order cancellations and customer returns. This bonus can really add up over time: one of our products, for example, generated $60k in referral bonus money over a seven-month period. The cherry on top? The bonus money also helps make leveraging external traffic easier for low-margin products.
Amazon Attribution is an easy tool to learn and a powerful way to keep growing your FBA business. The time you put into using it will easily pay off in the long run. Whether you’re currently running external campaigns or are planning to in the future, make sure to use it to track your sales.

------------------------
Reeling in ecommerce sales takes skill. But to tackle new markets, you need new tools in your box. Our sales chief helps you cast a wider net.
Your megahit coffee frother nabbed the Amazon Best Seller Badge moooonths ago. In fact, your whole line of coffee products are buzzworthy category leaders. Revenue is up and so are your margins. Impressive? You bet. But your growth doesn’t have to stop there.
For businesses at the peak of their Amazon game, the next step is brewing up a strong omnichannel strategy.
What is omnichannel?
People often use the term “omnichannel” when they’re simply selling products through multiple marketplaces and channels – Amazon, direct to consumer (DTC), retail, and maybe social commerce. But the endgame for a true omnichannel strategy is complete integration, so that your markets, sales data, the customer experience, and the brand are all part of one intelligent ecosystem. Each piece plays a role in lifting the business and delivers a personalized experience to the customer.
notes that over 85% of shopping is still happening in physical stores.
Is your brand retail ready?
Your product has to be unique.
at a great price.
You need a gross profit margin of at least 50%.
Wholesaling can yield excellent gross margins – and more control over those margins. You set your price, and (in general) it sticks, which makes it different from selling through Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), says Esposito. “It’s not a daily battle to fix your price against your competitors’ pricing, which can lead you to a dangerous race to the bottom.” You’re also not paying FBA fees or pouring money into pay-per-click ads to get eyes on your product page. But you will be fulfilling your own wholesale orders and complying with unique terms associated with major retail. You’ll incur more operating costs due to shipping errors, product returns, payment terms, and many unique service requirements by retailer. So you’ve got to be able to maintain healthy profit margins before considering a run at retail.
Assume you’re going to sell your product to retailers at a wholesale price that is a 50% discount from your full FBA retail. Depending on the category of the product, that’s a good rule of thumb (also known as keystone pricing).
Do your research.
For certain categories, like cleaning supplies, there are more than a dozen national retailers that could sell your product. In other categories, like toys, you may only be able to place your product with three or four retailers – saturating your opportunities fairly quickly.
To test the waters, think about what kind of store you want your product to be in and why. What else is on the shelves in that store? What makes your product different from those other brands? What customers are you trying to reach? And why is your product going to make a difference in their lives?
The answers to these questions are going to guide your retail strategy – what stores you’re going after and how you’re going to craft your pitch to their buyers (but more on that later).
What are the drawbacks?
Supply chain is different for retail. You need to partner with a third-party logistics (3PL) company that can fulfill retail and have a systems infrastructure that connects you seamlessly to your 3PL and customer. You’ll be challenged to meet different compliance regulations or standards for both your products and packaging – and again, these challenges can and will differ by retailer. This may require legal advice or design expertise. Traditional retail triggers a fundamentally different operating structure than an FBA brand.
Managing supply chain and inventory is one of the biggest challenges of moving from FBA to an in-store environment. In retail in particular, stocking out is just not an option. Empty shelves are a retailer’s money-losing nightmare. If you miss orders, you could be hit with hefty chargebacks that could sink your brand, not to mention your reputation among buyers. If you become a headache for a buyer, you’ll lose their business for good.
In retail, people really do shop with their eyes first, which also means you need a great packaging designer who gets the voice of your brand and can make your product stand out on store shelves. The retail shopper is confronted by a sea of products and packaging, and you have a split second to attract their attention and highlight the uniqueness of your product!
So how do you get your products in front of buyers?
According to Esposito, there are a few ways you can get your foot in the door with retailers.
First, attend trade shows for your category. Say you’re in the pet category. Just start Googling “top pet retail trade shows,” find one that looks like it suits your product best, and sign up. You’ll meet a lot of mom and pop buyers, but you’ll also build your network and learn from other attendees. Esposito also recommends setting up an account on faire.com, which is like an Amazon for wholesalers.
Another approach would be to contact a manufacturer’s representative. Again, a Google search will bring up a number of experienced representatives who know the industry and have established relationships with the buyers you’re trying to get your product in front of. They tend to work on a 5% commission for major accounts, but the cost might be well worth the guidance they provide. You can also meet these reps at trade shows or through referrals.
Lastly, try good old-fashioned cold calling. If you have a successful “digitally native” brand and can tout a category leadership position with great reviews, most retail merchants will give you a look. Bombard them with samples and category knowledge and they may be your next best friend!
When an omnichannel strategy is firing on all cylinders, all the channels synergistically play a role in lifting overall sales and building brand equity. “We call it the flywheel effect,” says Esposito.
. The pet odor eliminator spray is on the shelves of many Target and PetSmart stores. Someone shopping for dog food in Target may see a bottle of Angry Orange pet odor eliminator and not initially buy it. But later, when they’re searching for pet odor eliminator products on their phone and Angry Orange appears with an average customer review rating of 4.4 out of 5 stars, the customer knows it’s a trusted brand. After they pull the trigger on a purchase, we can then retarget that customer for additional purchases of Angry Orange products through ads on Amazon and Google.
We first brought Angry Orange to a few hardware stores. Products flew off the shelves, and we were able to share that success as proof positive that Angry Orange could make money for other national retailers.
If you’re a top seller in your category, chances are you’ve got a great product. And getting that product into as many hands as possible means meeting customers where they are – on their computers, their phones, and yes – in brick-and-mortar stores too.

By selling quality hammocks at an affordable price, Wise Owl founder Sarah Douglass hopes to help people make more lasting memories in nature.
, Sarah Douglass, remembers the day that she and her husband, Todd, walked out of a national outdoors retailer with all the equipment they needed for a backpacking trip – and an eye-popping receipt for $2,500.
That bothered her. A lot.
To Sarah, nature was a place for restoration and rejuvenation. She felt that everyone should be able to experience that – and the price of admission to the Great Outdoors, by her calculation, should be as close as possible to free.
Plenty of people have thoughts like these. But most people don’t have the ability, tenacity, or audacity to act on those ideas, much less see them through to completion.
in both the camping and patio categories, along with camping pillows, bug nets, and a whole bevy of hammock accessories.
ven a GED. According to standard career advice, those are minimum requirements for professional success. Sarah Douglass didn’t get that memo.
Her family went to Hawaii once — the only “real” vacation they ever took. Other than that, it was twice-yearly trips to the Strawberry Music Festival in Camp Mather near Yosemite. Families pitched tents or strung hammocks between the pines. There was folk and bluegrass music and jam sessions going all day and night. Kids roamed the woods and spent hours swimming and crafting. The whole experience ended with a Sunday revival at Birch Lake. For her, the festival was the pinnacle of childhood happiness; for her family, it also happened to be a vacation that was pretty close to free.
Around 18, Sarah briefly decided to try her hand at school again. She became pregnant. And that was that. She started a new chapter as a single parent, working 2 or 3 jobs at a time to raise her son. Of course, it was hard.
Sarah spent plenty of years working for other people. A pattern emerged. She’d learn the business until she could pretty much run the business, then she’d ask for a big raise, and walk if she didn’t get one. She walked a few times. She was good at working, liked working – it was the working “for other people” part that needed changing. Along the way, Sarah met her now-husband, Todd, who shared a similar set of values, including a desire to strike out and build a business they could call their own.
But hammocks were a no-fuss piece of equipment that represented happiness to Sarah. Within a few minutes, people could be set up, relaxing, and listening to the gurgle of a stream, ocean waves, or a breeze in the trees. Hammocks were a way to get people enjoying nature fast, easy, and on the cheap.
Hammocks, as a product, also had some clear business advantages: they were relatively simple to manufacture and their compact size made them economical to ship. The fabric color and style options were endless, so they could always be on trend as customer tastes changed. Plus, Wise Owl could produce a lot of hammock accessories to eventually expand its product line.
From the stitching thread counts to the way the seams felt on bare skin (after all, customers might be using a hammock while wearing shorts or a swimsuit), Sarah and Todd left no detail unexamined.
Of the low-cost models, none passed the Sarah test. Too scratchy, too small, poorly made, too difficult to set up. She found one she did love – but it came with a nearly $100 price tag.
They had a mission for their new Amazon ecommerce business: Make the greatest hammock anyone ever owned at half the price.
When she was dreaming up the Wise Owl brand, Sarah created a script for a video ad. In her storyboards, she would proffer a Wise Owl hammock toward the camera and explain to viewers that what she was holding in her hand was not in fact a hammock at all… but happiness. Wise Owl was selling the feeling she had in childhood, what she wanted everyone to experience themselves.
In 2015, Sarah and Todd drew down their savings to place her first purchase order of 200 hammocks. The day the products arrived on her doorstep was another lesson in the challenges of building an Amazon ecommerce business. She opened the box and … the Wise Owl logo was the wrong color. Even worse, the hammocks were stuffed into long and skinny carrying sacks. “They were basically two-foot-long sausages,” she says. She pulled them all apart and paid a local seamstress to fix every logo patch and every sack.
Today, Wise Owl is a booming online Amazon ecommerce business. The hammocks are nearing 40,000 ratings and maintain an impressive average of 4.8. Wise Owl has earned dual Best Seller Badges in both the camping hammocks and patio hammocks categories, while its camping pillows and hammock bug net also have Best Seller Badges. In 2021 alone, the brand sold hundreds of thousands of units in its product line. At the end of 2021, the Camping Hammock was capturing the majority of the market share for camping hammocks on Amazon.
hammocks will launch in the Canadian, UK, and German Amazon markets – a huge expansion for what started as a small Amazon ecommerce business.

------------------------
Every company has growing pains. To maintain a healthy outlook for your brand's future, don't overlook these key action items.
To strengthen the health of your FBA brand, it can pay to look beyond the bottom line. Have you grown a solid base of happy repeat customers? Or earned an avalanche of 5-star Amazon reviews for your products?  These are the kind of success markers that don’t directly appear on a profit and loss statement — but they can translate into higher customer lifetime value and a stronger FBA brand. In other words, to build an FBA brand with staying power, it helps to consider the big picture of your business.
Here are 4 strategies to think about.
If you’re used to thinking only about profit margin, you may want to start thinking about profit-dollars as well. Your goal should be to improve conversion rates and sales velocity on the products that provide the most bang for the buck in profit-dollars.
Conversion share is the number of times customers bought your product after searching with a given keyword, divided by the total number of times customers bought any product after searching with that same keyword. You want this number to grow over time. It shows you’re capturing a bigger slice of the pie linked to keywords associated with your product.
. The report is a gold mine of insights about your category and your FBA business.
to see which images perform best.
And yes, go for the video. A lot of people don’t incorporate video because it seems too hard or complex. Think of this: we’ve made very professional marketing videos with celebrities that have cost tens of thousands of dollars – and in some scenarios, those convert less than something made in 20 minutes on an iPhone. The lesson? It doesn’t have to be an insane production to be successful. It just needs to connect with customers.
Reviews are the lifeblood of an Amazon ecommerce business. You know this. When faced with an array of similar products, customers often default to the one with the most positive reviews. High-quality reviews start with a high-quality product, of course, but after that, you’ll need to do a little more work to earn your stars.
The work is well worth it. You want to create a moat of positive reviews around your products – an unbridgeable gap between your well-loved products and those of your closest competitors. And to increase your volume of positive reviews, you’ll need to increase your volume of sales. This may mean selling at a loss via a temporary price cut, running Amazon Deals, or increasing ad spending to boost traffic.

Lifelong Online’s co-founders built a powerhouse brand that put a dent in India’s appliance market. The secret to their success? Listen to who matters most – the customer.
market for ecommerce businesses. To be successful, brands must navigate the complexities of India’s delivery infrastructure. They also need to understand the diverse needs of Indian customers, what they want, how they shop, and what they value. In a country of 1.4 billion people, that is extraordinarily difficult.
Which is why the team charged with leading Thrasio’s foray into India are people who know what it takes to build a successful ecommerce brand there.
“It’s our customers, their stories, and their experiences with our products that really inspire me,” says Bharat Kalia, one the three co-founders and CEO of Lifelong Online (now called Lifelong, a Thrasio Company).
Kalia founded Lifelong in 2015 with two partners – Atul Raheja and Varun Grover. Since then, they’ve created more than 100 products, primarily in the kitchen-and-home, and health-and-fitness categories. Air fryers, stoves, stand mixers, treadmills, massagers, hair straighteners: a Lifelong product can be found in about a million homes in more than 500 cities.
The three founders of India-based company Lifelong, a Thrasio company.
But perhaps its biggest triumph is how Lifelong boldly entered the appliance market – a notoriously difficult category dominated by large, entrenched brands. “The products I was using in my home were the same my parents used,” Kalia says.
can be tucked behind a couch or under a bed – the ultimate solution for health-conscious Indians living in space-challenged homes. Today it is one of the best-selling products in the Lifelong line.
Or consider the case of Lifelong’s early version bicycle. Customers were frustrated with how much time and effort it took to put together. “People were saying ‘This is the hardest thing I ever did,’” Kalia says. The next version had just 5 moving parts and came 90% pre-assembled. Now they’re on version 3.
The customer is both king and queen at Lifelong.
A new product launch can involve 2 or 3 interactions with customers in a month, conversations that are coded and analyzed to ensure products are delivering happiness and satisfaction. “We analyze a ton of data and carefully codify our questions before making customer calls,” Kalia says.
This extraordinary openness to feedback goes back to Lifelong’s very first product, an oven toaster griller. In their enthusiasm, Kalia and the founders mounted a product listing before the product was actually ready. “We were super happy to get our first order,” Kalia says. “The problem was we only had a prototype.” He gave the customer a heads-up that the product was a bit of a work in progress – and then packed it up and mailed it across the country to the customer.
in less than prime condition. (“Basically, it was mangled,” Kalia says.) After multiple calls with the customer, Kalia delivered a new model to the customer within 2 weeks. After all that, the customer left Lifelong a positive review.
Lifelong’s employees hard at work building a next generation consumer goods company in India. Thrasio bought a majority share in Lifelong in January.
Lifelong’s goal of reaching every household in a country of 1.4 billion people will require keeping a careful eye on how the market is changing. People aren’t as tied to legacy brands as they once were, Kalia says, and younger generations are more comfortable with ecommerce.

, your gateway to building a better consumer goods company. Every edition, we’ll share stories, insights, and expertise on a topic critical to the industry. This issue: the importance of quality assurance and making sure the products you deliver truly deliver.
Your customers expect the best. Here are 5 steps to build a strong quality assurance program and become more effective at preventing the defective.
Everyone’s been there. You buy a product that you’re excited to use, and then, when you need it, it fails to live up to its claims. Total headache. But for a business owner, one defective item can potentially set off a torrent of torment: a batch that has to be recalled, poor reviews that affect customer acquisition and loyalty, and even additional rounds of production. Fortunately, a strong quality assurance program can save the day, catching defective products before they ever ship to your customers.
If you don’t have a program in place, fear not: Axel Gonzalez has your back. Thrasio’s senior director of quality assurance and sustainability shares 5 steps to get you started.
Take, for example, the premium 10-piece bartender set Thrasio sells through our Mixology & Craft brand. It’s a showpiece with a premium price point. As such, its form can’t have scratches, dirty marks, or any flaws in its shape. Its strainer has to snugly fit inside the shaker so that no liquid leaks, while each piece must also fit in the display stand. And in order to meet Mixology & Craft’s goal of creating delicious cocktails, the shakers need to function as closed vessels that allow you to quickly mix ingredients together while simultaneously chilling the drink. This bartender set needs to bring your dreams of perfect libations to life.
Take some time to think about how form, fit, and function apply to your products. Literally make a list. This is the start of your quality assurance program, how you’ll begin to understand which attributes need to be assessed and tested. Depending on the complexity of your product, it could be a long list. But by clearly identifying what really matters to your products early on, you’ll set yourself up for a smooth operation and strong defense against trouble down the road.
Once you’ve decided what you’re going to test for, you need a resource to guide you through the process. Enter the quality acceptance document.
“The quality acceptance document is essentially the playbook that you will use to carry out your product inspections,” Gonzalez notes.
Picture a playbook for an NFL team. At its most basic, you’ll have your coaching staff and players (or, who’s leading and conducting the testing process), your schedule (how often you test), and your gameplan (how you’ll conduct tests). Instead of using Xs and Os and other visual aids to run your plays, however, you’ll use pictures that help you tell which products will pass a quality check, which will fail, and why. The playbook will also outline the sample sizes you’ll test and define what percentage of defective products will signal the need to reject a whole batch.
Use your written explanation of ideal form, fit, and function to identify what imperfections to test for. These will fall into 1 of 3 categories: minor defect, major defect, or critical defect. For example, a scratch on a cocktail shaker might be considered a minor defect, while a warped shaker that doesn’t fit inside the other shaker could be deemed a critical defect. The amount of defects you find in your sample size will give you an idea about whether you can ship your products, need to do additional testing, or have to – sigh – reject the batch outright.
You can then come up with your own sample sizes and rejection thresholds, but the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) also has a standardized acceptance quality limit (AQL) sampling system for inspection by attributes. The AQL chart can be used to provide information and guidance on inspection levels, rejection thresholds, and sample sizes for individual shipments.
If this seems like a lot, it doesn’t have to be. You don’t want to go it alone when creating a quality acceptance document. Incorporate your supplier into the process.
“It only makes sense that your supplier agrees to everything in the document so that both parties are on the same page in terms of what is and is not acceptable,” Gonzalez says.
By having quality standards clearly laid out and agreed upon ahead of time, you reduce the risk of having a drawn-out dispute with your supplier over an unsatisfactory batch of product.
Striking the right balance on quality assurance can also be tricky. You have to take a bit of a Goldilocks approach with it. Too strict and you run the risk of rejecting too much product, which can lead to delays and stockouts. Too lax and defective products can end up making their way to customers, paving the way for negative reviews. Knowing early on what is realistic for your supplier to achieve from a quality standpoint can save you a lot of time and money down the road.
Oh … and if you’ve never built a quality acceptance document before, no problem.
Templates to help structure your document are available online.
Gonzalez strongly advises against relying on your manufacturer to carry out product inspections on your behalf. “You want an impartial inspector,” he says. “You need to insist on it. Otherwise, you can be left with a supplier who cuts corners when it comes to quality assurance in the hopes of avoiding rejects.” But, Gonzalez adds, there are a few things to keep in mind when looking for a solid third-party inspection company to partner with.
Third-party inspection companies need to be available on short notice. Our partner promises to have an agent on site and ready to conduct an inspection, anywhere in continental Asia, within 24 hours. This kind of flexibility is invaluable, as it minimizes delays across our vast network of suppliers. But even if you only have a few suppliers, if the past 2 years have taught us anything, it’s that unexpected delays and last-minute changes are a fact of life. Knowing that your third-party inspection company has the flexibility to swiftly react to these changes is a huge value-add.
Find an inspection company with top-notch technology platforms that allow you to quickly and easily access all of your inspection reports across your suppliers in real time. That’s especially helpful if you’ve got a lot of suppliers (and thus a lot of inspection reports).
Your third-party inspection company should be aligned with the material in your quality acceptance document. After all, they’ll be the ones carrying out the inspections. In their reports, data should be presented clearly and succinctly, allowing you to make quick, informed decisions on which products are ready to ship. A good inspection report will begin with a summary of the main findings, followed by detailed information to support those assessments. When vetting third-party inspection companies, it’s not a bad idea to ask them for sample reports to get a feel for how they present data.
Schedule inspections as soon as your products come off the line – the sooner the better. Why? That gives you time to course correct if there’s a problem. You don’t want to be caught with insufficient inventory because of extended retesting time frames or full-batch rejections.
There’s no “one size fits all” approach to quality assurance. Every product is unique. Even 2 sellers who sell a similar product may have different ideas about what quality testing should look like. And that’s OK. You’re taking steps that give your products the best chance to arrive on the doorsteps of your customers – exactly how they expect them to be.
Created to bring high-quality outdoor products to customers at an accessible price point, TrailBuddy doesn’t slow a hiker’s stroll. See how TrailBuddy gets customers off on the right foot – and captures 5-star reviews – with trekking poles that took this brand to the top.
The padded straps and moisture-wicking cork handles will mold to the shape of your hand for a secure and comfortable grip on each walking stick.
Crafted with sturdy 7075 aircraft-grade aluminum. Tougher and more lightweight than carbon fiber competitors.
Set to your desired height in seconds, from the 54" max height down to just 24.5" when fully collapsed.
Pole accessories for all terrains and weather conditions.
When quality is king, the stars align – at least, they do on Amazon.
and nearly 10,000 5-star reviews.
Customers in the U.S. loved the quality and performance of TrailBuddy’s trekking poles so much that we knew we had to expand our circles of hiking enthusiasts. Our International Launch team identified and successfully launched the poles in four new markets.

Thrasio erweitert den Horizont im Online-Handel. Wir wollen die beliebtesten Produkte aus aller Welt für jeden erreichbar machen. Hierfür arbeiten wir mit erfolgreichen E-Commerce-Unternehmen und Amazon FBA Sellern und nutzen unsere Expertise als Amazon-Aggregator, um ihre Geschäfte zu skalieren. Dabei setzen wir auf erfahrene Amazon-Experten, umfassende SEO-Kenntnisse, Bewertungen und Rezensionen, bewährte Supply-Chain-Prozesse und innovative Marketingstrategien.
Wir sind bessere Unternehmer geworden, denn jetzt haben wir ein gutes Modell für die Entwicklung weiterer Marken – und wir können uns auf die Unterstützung durch Thrasio jederzeit verlassen.
Ich bin beeindruckt, wie schnell Thrasio ans Werk geht, wie fair ihr Angebot war und wie gut sie mit unserer Unternehmensvision übereinstimmen. Ich habe mein zweites und drittes Geschäft ebenfalls an Thrasio verkauft.
Thrasio war in der Lage, über das Jahr 2020 hinweg konstant hohe Umsatzzahlen zu generieren – und das trotz der zahlreichen COVID-Einschränkungen für Produktion, Logistik und Versand. Für mich besteht kein Zweifel, dass sie diesen Herausforderungen besser als ich gewachsen waren.
Unsere Produkte liefern, was wir versprechen. Mit jeder Lieferung wollen wir Ihre Erwartungen nicht nur erfüllen, sondern übertreffen. Auf diese Weise haben wir uns zu einem der Top 5 Amazon-Seller entwickelt.
Gemeinsam bringen wir Ihre Produkte groß raus.

Während Thrasio expandiert, arbeiten wir hart daran, dass unser globales Bewusstsein noch schneller wächst. Unser Einfluss auf die Umwelt und die Gemeinden hilft uns bei der Entscheidungsfindung.
Im Rahmen unseres Programms für verantwortungsbewusste Beschaffung arbeiten wir mit dem weltweit führenden Wirtschaftsverband für offenen und nachhaltigen Handel amfori zusammen, um Instrumente und bewährte Verfahren zur Bewertung der sozialen Leistung unserer Lieferkette einzuführen. Die Lieferanten verpflichten sich, den amfori-Verhaltenskodex zu folgen, der 11 Grundsätze umfasst: von fairer Bezahlung bis zum Umweltschutz.
Im Rahmen unserer Initiative zur Nachhaltigkeit in der Lieferkette haben wir den Standard des Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol übernommen, um unsere Treibhausgasemissionen zu messen, zu verwalten und zu melden. Darüber hinaus haben wir uns mit Pathzero zusammengetan, um die GHG-Emissionen von Port-to-Port-Frachtgeschäften anhand der im Protokoll festgelegten Best Practices einzuschätzen.
Um die Gemeinschaften, in denen wir leben und arbeiten, zu stärken, haben wir bedeutsame, unterhaltsame und wirkungsvolle Mentoring- und philanthropische Möglichkeiten geschaffen.
Das Stipendium von Thrasio in Zusammenarbeit mit der Success Academy (SA) in Harlem bietet High-School-Schülern die Möglichkeit, von unseren Mitarbeitern zu lernen, wie man ein soziales Unternehmen von Grund auf recherchiert, aufbaut und erweitert. Stipendiaten arbeiten in Teams und werden nach mehreren Workshops mit Seed-Finanzierung belohnt, um in ihren Communitys mindestens ein akzeptables Produkt oder eine tragbare Dienstleistung zu starten. So wie Amazon es für kleine und mittlere Unternehmen (KMU) getan hat, hoffen wir auch, das Unternehmertum weiter zu demokratisieren, indem wir Studenten frühzeitig dazu inspirieren, ihr Potenzial als Unternehmer der Zukunft zu erkunden.
Mentorin bei BUILD zu sein, war eine sehr beeindruckende und aufschlussreiche Erfahrung. Es ist unglaublich zu sehen, mit welcher Leidenschaft ein Konzept in ein Produkt umgesetzt wird, auf das die Schüler stolz sind. Die Arbeit bei Thrasio gibt mir das Selbstvertrauen, diesen Studenten zu sagen, dass es eine Welt gibt, die ihren Unternehmergeist schätzt und ihre Lösungsfähigkeiten braucht.
Die Möglichkeit, meiner eigenen Mittelschule etwas zurückzugeben, war eine unglaubliche berufliche Leistung, die auch für mich persönlich sehr wichtig ist. Ich bin begeistert, dass ich in den Gemeinden, in denen ich aufgewachsen bin, etwas bewirken kann, und dass ich klugen jungen Köpfen neue Karrieremöglichkeiten eröffnen kann.
Wir ermutigen die Thrasher, unsere Politik der unbegrenzten bezahlten Freistellung zu nutzen und sich für die Themen einzusetzen, die ihnen am wichtigsten sind.
Machen Sie sich mit einer Gruppe positiver Menschen auf, die Zukunft zu gestalten.

Our leadership team is made up of Amazon veterans, e-commerce connoisseurs and successful entrepreneurs who are at the forefront of rethinking the way products are brought to the world.
Wer wagt, gewinnt. Josh Silberstein und Carlos Cashman verkörpern dieses Motto. Die beiden Thrasio Gründer trafen sich bei der Arbeit an einer Kampagne für die Schmuckmarke Bravelets von Stephanie Fox, die heute COO bei Thrasio ist. Trotz anfänglichen Erfolgen konnte die Marke aufgrund von externen Faktoren und mangelnden Ressourcen jedoch nie ihr volles Potenzial entfalten. Das brachte das Team auf eine Idee: Könnte man angeschlagene E-Commerce-Shops aufkaufen und diese mit Hilfe von skalierbaren Prozessen in die nächste Liga befördern? Gemeinsam wagten sie sich auf ein völlig neues Terrain vor. Dabei haben sie nicht nur den Amazon-Markt für Dritt-Anbieter aufgemischt, sondern eine komplett neue Branche geschaffen, deren Erfolg hunderte von Wettbewerbern hervorgebracht hat.

We bring products people love to the world.
At Thrasio, we’re reimagining how to make the world’s most-loved products accessible to everyone. So we work with successful sellers, using a deep understanding of rankings, ratings, and reviews – plus supply chain and marketing smarts – to transform the art and science of commerce.
We now feel like stronger business owners because we have a solid model for structuring any future brands we build—and can count on Thrasio to have our backs at any time.
I love how quickly Thrasio can move, how fair they are with their valuation, and how well they aligned with our vision. I returned to Thrasio to sell my second and third businesses.
Thrasio was able to consistently keep revenue strong through 2020 despite the numerous manufacturing, logistic, fulfillment constraints so many sellers faced during COVID. I don’t doubt they handled the account better than I could have myself given the same challenges.
Take a page from Thrasio’s playbook.
Actually, take 50 pages.
Get our book on getting your business ready for sale.
We make sure every Thrasio product delivered to your door delivers. And not just once, but every time, helping you make the most of every moment. It’s how we’ve become one of Amazon’s top 5 sellers.
If you’re looking to sell your Amazon business, we’re excited to work together.

As Thrasio expands across the world, we are committed to growing our global consciousness even faster. Our impact on the environment and the opportunity to lift people up help guide every decision we make.
Through our Responsible Sourcing Program, we partner with amfori, the leading global business association for open and sustainable trade, to implement tools and best practices that evaluate the social performance of our supply chain. Suppliers are committed to follow the amfori code of conduct – 11 principles ranging from fair payments to environmental protection.
As part of our Supply Chain Sustainability initiative, we’ve adopted the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol standard to measure, manage, and report our GHG emissions. We've also partnered with Pathzero to estimate GHG emissions from port-to-port freight operations, following best practices as specified in the Protocol.
To strengthen the communities in which we live and work, we’ve created meaningful, fun, and high-engagement mentorship and philanthropic opportunities.
Thrasio’s fellowship in collaboration with Success Academy (SA) in Harlem offers high school students the opportunity to learn from our employees how to research, build, and scale a social enterprise from scratch. Fellows work in teams and, after a series of workshops, are awarded seed funding to launch a minimum viable product or service in their communities. As Amazon has done for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), we also hope to further democratize entrepreneurship by inspiring students early on to explore their potential as the entrepreneurs of the future.
Being a mentor at BUILD has been a very humbling and eye-opening experience. It is incredible to see the passion that goes into developing a concept into a product that the students are proud of. Working at Thrasio gives me the confidence to tell these students that there is a world that values their entrepreneurial spirits and needs their problem-solving skills.
Being able to give back to my own middle school was an incredible professional accomplishment that’s also very important to me personally. I’m thrilled to be able to impact the communities where I grew up and to potentially introduce new career possibilities for bright young minds.
We encourage Thrashers to utilize our unlimited paid time off policy and take action on issues that are most meaningful to them.
Take off with a group of positive people out to define the future.

Some say fortune favors the brave. Josh and Carlos’ good fortune started when they met while working on a purpose-driven jewelry brand called Bravelets, founded by current Thrasio COO Stephanie Fox. Though the company was initially successful, environmental factors and a lack of resources kept it from growing to its maximum potential. This gave them an idea: What if they could roll up struggling ecommerce companies into one portfolio and use a single set of operators and scalable processes to take them to the next level? Talk about entering a brave new world. Together, they disrupted the 3P marketplace on Amazon and established a category that has gone on to inspire hundreds of competitors.

We bring products people love to the world.
At Thrasio, we’re reimagining how to make the world’s most-loved products accessible to everyone. So we work with successful sellers, using a deep understanding of rankings, ratings, and reviews – plus supply chain and marketing smarts – to transform the art and science of commerce.
We now feel like stronger business owners because we have a solid model for structuring any future brands we build—and can count on Thrasio to have our backs at any time.
I love how quickly Thrasio can move, how fair they are with their valuation, and how well they aligned with our vision. I returned to Thrasio to sell my second and third businesses.
Thrasio was able to consistently keep revenue strong through 2020 despite the numerous manufacturing, logistic, fulfillment constraints so many sellers faced during COVID. I don’t doubt they handled the account better than I could have myself given the same challenges.
Take a page from Thrasio’s playbook.
Actually, take 50 pages.
Get our book on getting your business ready for sale.
We make sure every Thrasio product delivered to your door delivers. And not just once, but every time, helping you make the most of every moment. It’s how we’ve become one of Amazon’s top 5 sellers.
If you’re looking to sell your Amazon business, we’re excited to work together.

Some say fortune favors the brave. Josh and Carlos’ good fortune started when they met while working on a purpose-driven jewelry brand called Bravelets, founded by current Thrasio COO Stephanie Fox. Though the company was initially successful, environmental factors and a lack of resources kept it from growing to its maximum potential. This gave them an idea: What if they could roll up struggling ecommerce companies into one portfolio and use a single set of operators and scalable processes to take them to the next level? Talk about entering a brave new world. Together, they disrupted the 3P marketplace on Amazon and established a category that has gone on to inspire hundreds of competitors.

Während Thrasio expandiert, arbeiten wir hart daran, dass unser globales Bewusstsein noch schneller wächst. Unser Einfluss auf die Umwelt und die Gemeinden hilft uns bei der Entscheidungsfindung.
Im Rahmen unseres Programms für verantwortungsbewusste Beschaffung arbeiten wir mit dem weltweit führenden Wirtschaftsverband für offenen und nachhaltigen Handel amfori zusammen, um Instrumente und bewährte Verfahren zur Bewertung der sozialen Leistung unserer Lieferkette einzuführen. Die Lieferanten verpflichten sich, den amfori-Verhaltenskodex zu folgen, der 11 Grundsätze umfasst: von fairer Bezahlung bis zum Umweltschutz.
Im Rahmen unserer Initiative zur Nachhaltigkeit in der Lieferkette haben wir den Standard des Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol übernommen, um unsere Treibhausgasemissionen zu messen, zu verwalten und zu melden. Darüber hinaus haben wir uns mit Pathzero zusammengetan, um die GHG-Emissionen von Port-to-Port-Frachtgeschäften anhand der im Protokoll festgelegten Best Practices einzuschätzen.
Um die Gemeinschaften, in denen wir leben und arbeiten, zu stärken, haben wir bedeutsame, unterhaltsame und wirkungsvolle Mentoring- und philanthropische Möglichkeiten geschaffen.
Das Stipendium von Thrasio in Zusammenarbeit mit der Success Academy (SA) in Harlem bietet High-School-Schülern die Möglichkeit, von unseren Mitarbeitern zu lernen, wie man ein soziales Unternehmen von Grund auf recherchiert, aufbaut und erweitert. Stipendiaten arbeiten in Teams und werden nach mehreren Workshops mit Seed-Finanzierung belohnt, um in ihren Communitys mindestens ein akzeptables Produkt oder eine tragbare Dienstleistung zu starten. So wie Amazon es für kleine und mittlere Unternehmen (KMU) getan hat, hoffen wir auch, das Unternehmertum weiter zu demokratisieren, indem wir Studenten frühzeitig dazu inspirieren, ihr Potenzial als Unternehmer der Zukunft zu erkunden.
Mentorin bei BUILD zu sein, war eine sehr beeindruckende und aufschlussreiche Erfahrung. Es ist unglaublich zu sehen, mit welcher Leidenschaft ein Konzept in ein Produkt umgesetzt wird, auf das die Schüler stolz sind. Die Arbeit bei Thrasio gibt mir das Selbstvertrauen, diesen Studenten zu sagen, dass es eine Welt gibt, die ihren Unternehmergeist schätzt und ihre Lösungsfähigkeiten braucht.
Die Möglichkeit, meiner eigenen Mittelschule etwas zurückzugeben, war eine unglaubliche berufliche Leistung, die auch für mich persönlich sehr wichtig ist. Ich bin begeistert, dass ich in den Gemeinden, in denen ich aufgewachsen bin, etwas bewirken kann, und dass ich klugen jungen Köpfen neue Karrieremöglichkeiten eröffnen kann.
Wir ermutigen die Thrasher, unsere Politik der unbegrenzten bezahlten Freistellung zu nutzen und sich für die Themen einzusetzen, die ihnen am wichtigsten sind.
Machen Sie sich mit einer Gruppe positiver Menschen auf, die Zukunft zu gestalten.

As Thrasio expands across the world, we are committed to growing our global consciousness even faster. Our impact on the environment and the opportunity to lift people up help guide every decision we make.
Through our Responsible Sourcing Program, we partner with amfori, the leading global business association for open and sustainable trade, to implement tools and best practices that evaluate the social performance of our supply chain. Suppliers are committed to follow the amfori code of conduct – 11 principles ranging from fair payments to environmental protection.
As part of our Supply Chain Sustainability initiative, we’ve adopted the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol standard to measure, manage, and report our GHG emissions. We've also partnered with Pathzero to estimate GHG emissions from port-to-port freight operations, following best practices as specified in the Protocol.
To strengthen the communities in which we live and work, we’ve created meaningful, fun, and high-engagement mentorship and philanthropic opportunities.
Thrasio’s fellowship in collaboration with Success Academy (SA) in Harlem offers high school students the opportunity to learn from our employees how to research, build, and scale a social enterprise from scratch. Fellows work in teams and, after a series of workshops, are awarded seed funding to launch a minimum viable product or service in their communities. As Amazon has done for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), we also hope to further democratize entrepreneurship by inspiring students early on to explore their potential as the entrepreneurs of the future.
Being a mentor at BUILD has been a very humbling and eye-opening experience. It is incredible to see the passion that goes into developing a concept into a product that the students are proud of. Working at Thrasio gives me the confidence to tell these students that there is a world that values their entrepreneurial spirits and needs their problem-solving skills.
Being able to give back to my own middle school was an incredible professional accomplishment that’s also very important to me personally. I’m thrilled to be able to impact the communities where I grew up and to potentially introduce new career possibilities for bright young minds.
We encourage Thrashers to utilize our unlimited paid time off policy and take action on issues that are most meaningful to them.
Take off with a group of positive people out to define the future.

Our leadership team is made up of Amazon veterans, e-commerce connoisseurs and successful entrepreneurs who are at the forefront of rethinking the way products are brought to the world.
Wer wagt, gewinnt. Josh Silberstein und Carlos Cashman verkörpern dieses Motto. Die beiden Thrasio Gründer trafen sich bei der Arbeit an einer Kampagne für die Schmuckmarke Bravelets von Stephanie Fox, die heute COO bei Thrasio ist. Trotz anfänglichen Erfolgen konnte die Marke aufgrund von externen Faktoren und mangelnden Ressourcen jedoch nie ihr volles Potenzial entfalten. Das brachte das Team auf eine Idee: Könnte man angeschlagene E-Commerce-Shops aufkaufen und diese mit Hilfe von skalierbaren Prozessen in die nächste Liga befördern? Gemeinsam wagten sie sich auf ein völlig neues Terrain vor. Dabei haben sie nicht nur den Amazon-Markt für Dritt-Anbieter aufgemischt, sondern eine komplett neue Branche geschaffen, deren Erfolg hunderte von Wettbewerbern hervorgebracht hat.

I love how quickly Thrasio can move, how fair they are with their valuation, and how well they aligned with our vision. I returned to Thrasio to sell my second and third businesses.
Thrasio was able to consistently keep revenue strong through 2020 despite the numerous manufacturing, logistic, fulfillment constraints so many sellers faced during COVID. I don’t doubt they handled the account better than I could have myself given the same challenges.

Three of our brand owners share hot takes and takeaways after logging huge sales during Amazon’s fall event.
from Amazon’s Prime Early Access Sale (“PEAS”) is revealing that the products with big sales didn’t come with big price tags. For Thrasio, this meant the event and many of our brands went together like PEAS and carrots, with several of those brands having their best days yet.
In our new Q&A series “Best in Thras,” we teased out some reflections on PEAS with three questions for three Thrashers whose brands cooked the competition.
. It snatched a top spot in Lightning Deals and reached #2 best-seller status in pet supplies.
136,440 hours of colorful dancing flames keeping customers warm this winter.
™ glow-in-the-dark basketballs, footballs, and soccer balls. All three products simultaneously held the #1 best-seller spot during the sale, and the brand absolutely crushed it with sales 1,000% bigger than July’s Prime Day, for its biggest Prime Day yet.
Why was your brand successful during this event?
Choosing an attractive price point for our customers helps a lot.
In addition, we were able to obtain a lot of affiliate assistance for external traffic while leveraging coupons.
: We ran three Lightning Deals on the top Magical Flames listings, stacking them with coupons and exclusive discounts for affiliate/influencer partners, to create attractive final price points for our customers across all pack sizes. Additionally, leading into PEAS, we launched 600+ new Amazon PPC campaigns, which drove rank and sessions on key upper funnel keywords.
: We leaned into the available Amazon promotions, ran analysis of deals on those promotional prices, and had great discounts at a great time of year. Soccer, football and basketball seasons are all starting, it’s getting darker outside earlier and GlowCity is a great gift for the holidays.
How will you extend and/or learn from that success to have a strong Turkey 5?
: We will continue to push for brand recognition off of Amazon by working with affiliates, running Facebook ads, and leveraging TikTok – as well as YouTube soon.
for conversions and brand recognition while running a Top Deal. We are also making sure we are positioned with enough inventory to sell through November, December, and deals.
: Given the historical “stocking stuffer” appeal for Magical Flames, we will lean heavily into this theme heading into T5 via strategic copy updates, paid traffic campaigns, and affiliate/influencer coverage. Improving brand exposure for Magical Flames on these search terms will enable our Turkey 5 Lightning Deals to reach a larger set of customers. Furthermore, we will look beyond Turkey 5 to continue offering attractive deals up until the Christmas delivery cutoff.
: Inventory is not unlimited, so we’ll set specific deal unit limits to maintain healthy inventory throughout Q4.
On T5, a deal can really take off, which is great. But you want to make sure you leave inventory to capture higher margin sales from the “halo” effect of deals. On GlowCity, our sales were up nearly 100 percent the week following PEAS compared to the week before.
What piece of advice would you give to sellers coming out of PEAS?
: Leverage coupons and price your product to sell during high traffic events. Then ride the algorithm spike wave at a higher price point.
: Do not undersell the power of deal and coupon stacking when trying to improve your deals page placement. Stacked coupons may not be visible on the deals page, but they positively impact conversion, which bodes well with Amazon’s ranking algorithm.
: Nothing too extraordinary here; run some final optimization tests over the next few weeks (creative, copy, etc.), work to have strong keyword rank the week leading into T5, and utilize the promotions Amazon offers. Choose the promotions that match the goals for your products – promotions have varying discounts and expected lifts.

------------------------
External traffic is critical to boosting sales and revenue from your Amazon listings. Measuring its performance is simple with this solution.
Rising PPC costs. Shifting consumer behavior. Increased competition. Just when you think you’ve got a handle on the best marketing strategy to drive sales to your Amazon FBA business, a new challenge pops up like some twisted game of Whac-A-Mole. That’s why it’s never been more important to have a comprehensive strategy that meets consumers wherever they are and is capable of handling new tests and surprises.
or preparing to sell, this tool will make your marketing efforts more fruitful and possibly increase the valuation of your company.
What is Amazon Attribution?
. Amazon Attribution is a solution created by Amazon to serve a similar need: the measurement of marketing channel performance on your site; in this case, that refers to non-Amazon marketing channel performance on your Amazon listing.
As you might know, advertisers are unable to place tracking pixels on their Amazon listings – so this tool is key to tracking your marketing performance. While still in beta, Amazon Attribution has been around for some time. It allows you to append URL parameters to your ads and pass information like campaign, ad group, channel, and publisher to the attribution console. This allows you to measure detailed product views (DPVs), add to carts (ATCs), units sold, total revenue, and more from your external traffic campaigns.
In addition to informing better ad spend decisions, Amazon Attribution ensures you have line of sight into conversions, which are paramount to ranking well in organic Amazon searches. Driving too much non-converting traffic to your listing risks hurting your Amazon SEO performance. In addition, advertisers receive a referral bonus from Amazon for every sale they generate via Amazon Attribution (more on this later).
.
From here you have two options: create the campaign manually or upload a file to create in bulk.
We recommend leveraging the bulk file creation flow if you’re starting with a paid search campaign. If you’re testing a paid social campaign you can use the manual creation flow.
Once you have the template you’ll want to create your campaign in the Google Ads editor and post it to Google/Bing as paused. From there you’ll need to download your keywords from Google and input the data into the bulk upload template columns below. Next, add the products you’d like to track in the products section.
Once the final URL suffix is added you’re ready to launch your campaign! There are also third-party tools that automate this process, but the manual flow is a great place to start if you’re using attribution for the first time.
As with any marketing tool, Amazon Attribution does have limitations. It’s important to note that once a campaign is launched it takes two full days for sales data to backfill completely. Because of this, we recommend ramping up campaigns gradually so you can optimize based on conversion data before really scaling up.
Amazon Attribution also uses a last-click attribution model with a 14-day look-back window. This model gives full credit for a sale or conversion to the touchpoint a customer last clicked on or engaged with before making a purchase. This is critical to keep in mind when analyzing campaign performance, because single-touch attribution models only tell part of the story.
Finally, to maintain user privacy Amazon masks conversion data for keywords that have not met the required daily click threshold. The banner below will indicate if you’re experiencing conversion masking in your campaigns.
This click threshold is cumulative, which means that viewing conversion data at the campaign level will provide the most accurate conversion amount for your campaigns. The click threshold is small but must be met for conversion data to appear. Conversions will not show at the ad group level if the particular ad group has not met that daily click threshold.
. On average, brands can earn a 10 percent bonus from qualifying sales simply by signing up. To calculate how much you may receive, multiply your qualifying sales from the relevant product category by the corresponding minimum bonus rate in the table below. Amazon now includes this amount in the reporting section of Attribution.
There is a two-month waiting period to receive the credit to your account, which accommodates order cancellations and customer returns. This bonus can really add up over time: one of our products, for example, generated $60k in referral bonus money over a seven-month period. The cherry on top? The bonus money also helps make leveraging external traffic easier for low-margin products.
Amazon Attribution is an easy tool to learn and a powerful way to keep growing your FBA business. The time you put into using it will easily pay off in the long run. Whether you’re currently running external campaigns or are planning to in the future, make sure to use it to track your sales.

https://www.thrasio.com/resources/blog/secrets-to-omnichannel-and-retail
------------------------
Reeling in ecommerce sales takes skill. But to tackle new markets, you need new tools in your box. Our sales chief helps you cast a wider net.
Your megahit coffee frother nabbed the Amazon Best Seller Badge moooonths ago. In fact, your whole line of coffee products are buzzworthy category leaders. Revenue is up and so are your margins. Impressive? You bet. But your growth doesn’t have to stop there.
For businesses at the peak of their Amazon game, the next step is brewing up a strong omnichannel strategy.
What is omnichannel?
People often use the term “omnichannel” when they’re simply selling products through multiple marketplaces and channels – Amazon, direct to consumer (DTC), retail, and maybe social commerce. But the endgame for a true omnichannel strategy is complete integration, so that your markets, sales data, the customer experience, and the brand are all part of one intelligent ecosystem. Each piece plays a role in lifting the business and delivers a personalized experience to the customer.
notes that over 85% of shopping is still happening in physical stores.
Is your brand retail ready?
Your product has to be unique.
at a great price.
You need a gross profit margin of at least 50%.
Wholesaling can yield excellent gross margins – and more control over those margins. You set your price, and (in general) it sticks, which makes it different from selling through Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), says Esposito. “It’s not a daily battle to fix your price against your competitors’ pricing, which can lead you to a dangerous race to the bottom.” You’re also not paying FBA fees or pouring money into pay-per-click ads to get eyes on your product page. But you will be fulfilling your own wholesale orders and complying with unique terms associated with major retail. You’ll incur more operating costs due to shipping errors, product returns, payment terms, and many unique service requirements by retailer. So you’ve got to be able to maintain healthy profit margins before considering a run at retail.
Assume you’re going to sell your product to retailers at a wholesale price that is a 50% discount from your full FBA retail. Depending on the category of the product, that’s a good rule of thumb (also known as keystone pricing).
Do your research.
For certain categories, like cleaning supplies, there are more than a dozen national retailers that could sell your product. In other categories, like toys, you may only be able to place your product with three or four retailers – saturating your opportunities fairly quickly.
To test the waters, think about what kind of store you want your product to be in and why. What else is on the shelves in that store? What makes your product different from those other brands? What customers are you trying to reach? And why is your product going to make a difference in their lives?
The answers to these questions are going to guide your retail strategy – what stores you’re going after and how you’re going to craft your pitch to their buyers (but more on that later).
What are the drawbacks?
Supply chain is different for retail. You need to partner with a third-party logistics (3PL) company that can fulfill retail and have a systems infrastructure that connects you seamlessly to your 3PL and customer. You’ll be challenged to meet different compliance regulations or standards for both your products and packaging – and again, these challenges can and will differ by retailer. This may require legal advice or design expertise. Traditional retail triggers a fundamentally different operating structure than an FBA brand.
Managing supply chain and inventory is one of the biggest challenges of moving from FBA to an in-store environment. In retail in particular, stocking out is just not an option. Empty shelves are a retailer’s money-losing nightmare. If you miss orders, you could be hit with hefty chargebacks that could sink your brand, not to mention your reputation among buyers. If you become a headache for a buyer, you’ll lose their business for good.
In retail, people really do shop with their eyes first, which also means you need a great packaging designer who gets the voice of your brand and can make your product stand out on store shelves. The retail shopper is confronted by a sea of products and packaging, and you have a split second to attract their attention and highlight the uniqueness of your product!
So how do you get your products in front of buyers?
According to Esposito, there are a few ways you can get your foot in the door with retailers.
First, attend trade shows for your category. Say you’re in the pet category. Just start Googling “top pet retail trade shows,” find one that looks like it suits your product best, and sign up. You’ll meet a lot of mom and pop buyers, but you’ll also build your network and learn from other attendees. Esposito also recommends setting up an account on faire.com, which is like an Amazon for wholesalers.
Another approach would be to contact a manufacturer’s representative. Again, a Google search will bring up a number of experienced representatives who know the industry and have established relationships with the buyers you’re trying to get your product in front of. They tend to work on a 5% commission for major accounts, but the cost might be well worth the guidance they provide. You can also meet these reps at trade shows or through referrals.
Lastly, try good old-fashioned cold calling. If you have a successful “digitally native” brand and can tout a category leadership position with great reviews, most retail merchants will give you a look. Bombard them with samples and category knowledge and they may be your next best friend!
When an omnichannel strategy is firing on all cylinders, all the channels synergistically play a role in lifting overall sales and building brand equity. “We call it the flywheel effect,” says Esposito.
. The pet odor eliminator spray is on the shelves of many Target and PetSmart stores. Someone shopping for dog food in Target may see a bottle of Angry Orange pet odor eliminator and not initially buy it. But later, when they’re searching for pet odor eliminator products on their phone and Angry Orange appears with an average customer review rating of 4.4 out of 5 stars, the customer knows it’s a trusted brand. After they pull the trigger on a purchase, we can then retarget that customer for additional purchases of Angry Orange products through ads on Amazon and Google.
We first brought Angry Orange to a few hardware stores. Products flew off the shelves, and we were able to share that success as proof positive that Angry Orange could make money for other national retailers.
If you’re a top seller in your category, chances are you’ve got a great product. And getting that product into as many hands as possible means meeting customers where they are – on their computers, their phones, and yes – in brick-and-mortar stores too.

By selling quality hammocks at an affordable price, Wise Owl founder Sarah Douglass hopes to help people make more lasting memories in nature.
, Sarah Douglass, remembers the day that she and her husband, Todd, walked out of a national outdoors retailer with all the equipment they needed for a backpacking trip – and an eye-popping receipt for $2,500.
That bothered her. A lot.
To Sarah, nature was a place for restoration and rejuvenation. She felt that everyone should be able to experience that – and the price of admission to the Great Outdoors, by her calculation, should be as close as possible to free.
Plenty of people have thoughts like these. But most people don’t have the ability, tenacity, or audacity to act on those ideas, much less see them through to completion.
in both the camping and patio categories, along with camping pillows, bug nets, and a whole bevy of hammock accessories.
ven a GED. According to standard career advice, those are minimum requirements for professional success. Sarah Douglass didn’t get that memo.
Her family went to Hawaii once — the only “real” vacation they ever took. Other than that, it was twice-yearly trips to the Strawberry Music Festival in Camp Mather near Yosemite. Families pitched tents or strung hammocks between the pines. There was folk and bluegrass music and jam sessions going all day and night. Kids roamed the woods and spent hours swimming and crafting. The whole experience ended with a Sunday revival at Birch Lake. For her, the festival was the pinnacle of childhood happiness; for her family, it also happened to be a vacation that was pretty close to free.
Around 18, Sarah briefly decided to try her hand at school again. She became pregnant. And that was that. She started a new chapter as a single parent, working 2 or 3 jobs at a time to raise her son. Of course, it was hard.
Sarah spent plenty of years working for other people. A pattern emerged. She’d learn the business until she could pretty much run the business, then she’d ask for a big raise, and walk if she didn’t get one. She walked a few times. She was good at working, liked working – it was the working “for other people” part that needed changing. Along the way, Sarah met her now-husband, Todd, who shared a similar set of values, including a desire to strike out and build a business they could call their own.
But hammocks were a no-fuss piece of equipment that represented happiness to Sarah. Within a few minutes, people could be set up, relaxing, and listening to the gurgle of a stream, ocean waves, or a breeze in the trees. Hammocks were a way to get people enjoying nature fast, easy, and on the cheap.
Hammocks, as a product, also had some clear business advantages: they were relatively simple to manufacture and their compact size made them economical to ship. The fabric color and style options were endless, so they could always be on trend as customer tastes changed. Plus, Wise Owl could produce a lot of hammock accessories to eventually expand its product line.
From the stitching thread counts to the way the seams felt on bare skin (after all, customers might be using a hammock while wearing shorts or a swimsuit), Sarah and Todd left no detail unexamined.
Of the low-cost models, none passed the Sarah test. Too scratchy, too small, poorly made, too difficult to set up. She found one she did love – but it came with a nearly $100 price tag.
They had a mission for their new Amazon ecommerce business: Make the greatest hammock anyone ever owned at half the price.
When she was dreaming up the Wise Owl brand, Sarah created a script for a video ad. In her storyboards, she would proffer a Wise Owl hammock toward the camera and explain to viewers that what she was holding in her hand was not in fact a hammock at all… but happiness. Wise Owl was selling the feeling she had in childhood, what she wanted everyone to experience themselves.
In 2015, Sarah and Todd drew down their savings to place her first purchase order of 200 hammocks. The day the products arrived on her doorstep was another lesson in the challenges of building an Amazon ecommerce business. She opened the box and … the Wise Owl logo was the wrong color. Even worse, the hammocks were stuffed into long and skinny carrying sacks. “They were basically two-foot-long sausages,” she says. She pulled them all apart and paid a local seamstress to fix every logo patch and every sack.
Today, Wise Owl is a booming online Amazon ecommerce business. The hammocks are nearing 40,000 ratings and maintain an impressive average of 4.8. Wise Owl has earned dual Best Seller Badges in both the camping hammocks and patio hammocks categories, while its camping pillows and hammock bug net also have Best Seller Badges. In 2021 alone, the brand sold hundreds of thousands of units in its product line. At the end of 2021, the Camping Hammock was capturing the majority of the market share for camping hammocks on Amazon.
hammocks will launch in the Canadian, UK, and German Amazon markets – a huge expansion for what started as a small Amazon ecommerce business.
, but like many entrepreneurs, she’s not really one to… just rest.

------------------------
Every company has growing pains. To maintain a healthy outlook for your brand's future, don't overlook these key action items.
To strengthen the health of your FBA brand, it can pay to look beyond the bottom line. Have you grown a solid base of happy repeat customers? Or earned an avalanche of 5-star Amazon reviews for your products?  These are the kind of success markers that don’t directly appear on a profit and loss statement — but they can translate into higher customer lifetime value and a stronger FBA brand. In other words, to build an FBA brand with staying power, it helps to consider the big picture of your business.
Here are 4 strategies to think about.
If you’re used to thinking only about profit margin, you may want to start thinking about profit-dollars as well. Your goal should be to improve conversion rates and sales velocity on the products that provide the most bang for the buck in profit-dollars.
Conversion share is the number of times customers bought your product after searching with a given keyword, divided by the total number of times customers bought any product after searching with that same keyword. You want this number to grow over time. It shows you’re capturing a bigger slice of the pie linked to keywords associated with your product.
. The report is a gold mine of insights about your category and your FBA business.
to see which images perform best.
And yes, go for the video. A lot of people don’t incorporate video because it seems too hard or complex. Think of this: we’ve made very professional marketing videos with celebrities that have cost tens of thousands of dollars – and in some scenarios, those convert less than something made in 20 minutes on an iPhone. The lesson? It doesn’t have to be an insane production to be successful. It just needs to connect with customers.
Reviews are the lifeblood of an Amazon ecommerce business. You know this. When faced with an array of similar products, customers often default to the one with the most positive reviews. High-quality reviews start with a high-quality product, of course, but after that, you’ll need to do a little more work to earn your stars.
The work is well worth it. You want to create a moat of positive reviews around your products – an unbridgeable gap between your well-loved products and those of your closest competitors. And to increase your volume of positive reviews, you’ll need to increase your volume of sales. This may mean selling at a loss via a temporary price cut, running Amazon Deals, or increasing ad spending to boost traffic.

Lifelong Online’s co-founders built a powerhouse brand that put a dent in India’s appliance market. The secret to their success? Listen to who matters most – the customer.
market for ecommerce businesses. To be successful, brands must navigate the complexities of India’s delivery infrastructure. They also need to understand the diverse needs of Indian customers, what they want, how they shop, and what they value. In a country of 1.4 billion people, that is extraordinarily difficult.
Which is why the team charged with leading Thrasio’s foray into India are people who know what it takes to build a successful ecommerce brand there.
“It’s our customers, their stories, and their experiences with our products that really inspire me,” says Bharat Kalia, one the three co-founders and CEO of Lifelong Online (now called Lifelong, a Thrasio Company).
Kalia founded Lifelong in 2015 with two partners – Atul Raheja and Varun Grover. Since then, they’ve created more than 100 products, primarily in the kitchen-and-home, and health-and-fitness categories. Air fryers, stoves, stand mixers, treadmills, massagers, hair straighteners: a Lifelong product can be found in about a million homes in more than 500 cities.
The three founders of India-based company Lifelong, a Thrasio company.
But perhaps its biggest triumph is how Lifelong boldly entered the appliance market – a notoriously difficult category dominated by large, entrenched brands. “The products I was using in my home were the same my parents used,” Kalia says.
can be tucked behind a couch or under a bed – the ultimate solution for health-conscious Indians living in space-challenged homes. Today it is one of the best-selling products in the Lifelong line.
Or consider the case of Lifelong’s early version bicycle. Customers were frustrated with how much time and effort it took to put together. “People were saying ‘This is the hardest thing I ever did,’” Kalia says. The next version had just 5 moving parts and came 90% pre-assembled. Now they’re on version 3.
The customer is both king and queen at Lifelong.
A new product launch can involve 2 or 3 interactions with customers in a month, conversations that are coded and analyzed to ensure products are delivering happiness and satisfaction. “We analyze a ton of data and carefully codify our questions before making customer calls,” Kalia says.
This extraordinary openness to feedback goes back to Lifelong’s very first product, an oven toaster griller. In their enthusiasm, Kalia and the founders mounted a product listing before the product was actually ready. “We were super happy to get our first order,” Kalia says. “The problem was we only had a prototype.” He gave the customer a heads-up that the product was a bit of a work in progress – and then packed it up and mailed it across the country to the customer.
in less than prime condition. (“Basically, it was mangled,” Kalia says.) After multiple calls with the customer, Kalia delivered a new model to the customer within 2 weeks. After all that, the customer left Lifelong a positive review.
Lifelong’s employees hard at work building a next generation consumer goods company in India. Thrasio bought a majority share in Lifelong in January.
Lifelong’s goal of reaching every household in a country of 1.4 billion people will require keeping a careful eye on how the market is changing. People aren’t as tied to legacy brands as they once were, Kalia says, and younger generations are more comfortable with ecommerce.

, your gateway to building a better consumer goods company. Every edition, we’ll share stories, insights, and expertise on a topic critical to the industry. This issue: the importance of quality assurance and making sure the products you deliver truly deliver.
Your customers expect the best. Here are 5 steps to build a strong quality assurance program and become more effective at preventing the defective.
Everyone’s been there. You buy a product that you’re excited to use, and then, when you need it, it fails to live up to its claims. Total headache. But for a business owner, one defective item can potentially set off a torrent of torment: a batch that has to be recalled, poor reviews that affect customer acquisition and loyalty, and even additional rounds of production. Fortunately, a strong quality assurance program can save the day, catching defective products before they ever ship to your customers.
If you don’t have a program in place, fear not: Axel Gonzalez has your back. Thrasio’s senior director of quality assurance and sustainability shares 5 steps to get you started.
Take, for example, the premium 10-piece bartender set Thrasio sells through our Mixology & Craft brand. It’s a showpiece with a premium price point. As such, its form can’t have scratches, dirty marks, or any flaws in its shape. Its strainer has to snugly fit inside the shaker so that no liquid leaks, while each piece must also fit in the display stand. And in order to meet Mixology & Craft’s goal of creating delicious cocktails, the shakers need to function as closed vessels that allow you to quickly mix ingredients together while simultaneously chilling the drink. This bartender set needs to bring your dreams of perfect libations to life.
Take some time to think about how form, fit, and function apply to your products. Literally make a list. This is the start of your quality assurance program, how you’ll begin to understand which attributes need to be assessed and tested. Depending on the complexity of your product, it could be a long list. But by clearly identifying what really matters to your products early on, you’ll set yourself up for a smooth operation and strong defense against trouble down the road.
Once you’ve decided what you’re going to test for, you need a resource to guide you through the process. Enter the quality acceptance document.
“The quality acceptance document is essentially the playbook that you will use to carry out your product inspections,” Gonzalez notes.
Picture a playbook for an NFL team. At its most basic, you’ll have your coaching staff and players (or, who’s leading and conducting the testing process), your schedule (how often you test), and your gameplan (how you’ll conduct tests). Instead of using Xs and Os and other visual aids to run your plays, however, you’ll use pictures that help you tell which products will pass a quality check, which will fail, and why. The playbook will also outline the sample sizes you’ll test and define what percentage of defective products will signal the need to reject a whole batch.
Use your written explanation of ideal form, fit, and function to identify what imperfections to test for. These will fall into 1 of 3 categories: minor defect, major defect, or critical defect. For example, a scratch on a cocktail shaker might be considered a minor defect, while a warped shaker that doesn’t fit inside the other shaker could be deemed a critical defect. The amount of defects you find in your sample size will give you an idea about whether you can ship your products, need to do additional testing, or have to – sigh – reject the batch outright.
You can then come up with your own sample sizes and rejection thresholds, but the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) also has a standardized acceptance quality limit (AQL) sampling system for inspection by attributes. The AQL chart can be used to provide information and guidance on inspection levels, rejection thresholds, and sample sizes for individual shipments.
If this seems like a lot, it doesn’t have to be. You don’t want to go it alone when creating a quality acceptance document. Incorporate your supplier into the process.
“It only makes sense that your supplier agrees to everything in the document so that both parties are on the same page in terms of what is and is not acceptable,” Gonzalez says.
By having quality standards clearly laid out and agreed upon ahead of time, you reduce the risk of having a drawn-out dispute with your supplier over an unsatisfactory batch of product.
Striking the right balance on quality assurance can also be tricky. You have to take a bit of a Goldilocks approach with it. Too strict and you run the risk of rejecting too much product, which can lead to delays and stockouts. Too lax and defective products can end up making their way to customers, paving the way for negative reviews. Knowing early on what is realistic for your supplier to achieve from a quality standpoint can save you a lot of time and money down the road.
Oh … and if you’ve never built a quality acceptance document before, no problem.
Templates to help structure your document are available online.
Gonzalez strongly advises against relying on your manufacturer to carry out product inspections on your behalf. “You want an impartial inspector,” he says. “You need to insist on it. Otherwise, you can be left with a supplier who cuts corners when it comes to quality assurance in the hopes of avoiding rejects.” But, Gonzalez adds, there are a few things to keep in mind when looking for a solid third-party inspection company to partner with.
Third-party inspection companies need to be available on short notice. Our partner promises to have an agent on site and ready to conduct an inspection, anywhere in continental Asia, within 24 hours. This kind of flexibility is invaluable, as it minimizes delays across our vast network of suppliers. But even if you only have a few suppliers, if the past 2 years have taught us anything, it’s that unexpected delays and last-minute changes are a fact of life. Knowing that your third-party inspection company has the flexibility to swiftly react to these changes is a huge value-add.
Find an inspection company with top-notch technology platforms that allow you to quickly and easily access all of your inspection reports across your suppliers in real time. That’s especially helpful if you’ve got a lot of suppliers (and thus a lot of inspection reports).
Your third-party inspection company should be aligned with the material in your quality acceptance document. After all, they’ll be the ones carrying out the inspections. In their reports, data should be presented clearly and succinctly, allowing you to make quick, informed decisions on which products are ready to ship. A good inspection report will begin with a summary of the main findings, followed by detailed information to support those assessments. When vetting third-party inspection companies, it’s not a bad idea to ask them for sample reports to get a feel for how they present data.
Schedule inspections as soon as your products come off the line – the sooner the better. Why? That gives you time to course correct if there’s a problem. You don’t want to be caught with insufficient inventory because of extended retesting time frames or full-batch rejections.
There’s no “one size fits all” approach to quality assurance. Every product is unique. Even 2 sellers who sell a similar product may have different ideas about what quality testing should look like. And that’s OK. You’re taking steps that give your products the best chance to arrive on the doorsteps of your customers – exactly how they expect them to be.

We bring products people love to the world.
At Thrasio, we’re reimagining how to make the world’s most-loved products accessible to everyone. So we work with successful sellers, using a deep understanding of rankings, ratings, and reviews – plus supply chain and marketing smarts – to transform the art and science of commerce.
We now feel like stronger business owners because we have a solid model for structuring any future brands we build — and can count on Thrasio to have our backs at any time.
I love how quickly Thrasio can move, how fair they are with their valuation, and how well they aligned with our vision. I returned to Thrasio to sell my second and third businesses.
Thrasio was able to consistently keep revenue strong through 2020 despite the numerous manufacturing, logistic, fulfillment constraints so many sellers faced during COVID. I don’t doubt they handled the account better than I could have myself given the same challenges.
Take a page from Thrasio’s playbook.

We make sure every Thrasio product delivered to your door delivers. And not just once, but every time, helping you make the most of every moment. It’s how we’ve become one of Amazon’s top 5 sellers.
If you’re looking to sell your Amazon business, we’re excited to work together.

Während Thrasio expandiert, arbeiten wir hart daran, dass unser globales Bewusstsein noch schneller wächst. Unser Einfluss auf die Umwelt und die Gemeinden hilft uns bei der Entscheidungsfindung.
Im Rahmen unseres Programms für verantwortungsbewusste Beschaffung arbeiten wir mit dem weltweit führenden Wirtschaftsverband für offenen und nachhaltigen Handel amfori zusammen, um Instrumente und bewährte Verfahren zur Bewertung der sozialen Leistung unserer Lieferkette einzuführen. Die Lieferanten verpflichten sich, den amfori-Verhaltenskodex zu folgen, der 11 Grundsätze umfasst: von fairer Bezahlung bis zum Umweltschutz.
Im Rahmen unserer Initiative zur Nachhaltigkeit in der Lieferkette haben wir den Standard des Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol übernommen, um unsere Treibhausgasemissionen zu messen, zu verwalten und zu melden. Darüber hinaus haben wir uns mit Pathzero zusammengetan, um die GHG-Emissionen von Port-to-Port-Frachtgeschäften anhand der im Protokoll festgelegten Best Practices einzuschätzen.
Um die Gemeinschaften, in denen wir leben und arbeiten, zu stärken, haben wir bedeutsame, unterhaltsame und wirkungsvolle Mentoring- und philanthropische Möglichkeiten geschaffen.
Das Stipendium von Thrasio in Zusammenarbeit mit der Success Academy (SA) in Harlem bietet High-School-Schülern die Möglichkeit, von unseren Mitarbeitern zu lernen, wie man ein soziales Unternehmen von Grund auf recherchiert, aufbaut und erweitert. Stipendiaten arbeiten in Teams und werden nach mehreren Workshops mit Seed-Finanzierung belohnt, um in ihren Communitys mindestens ein akzeptables Produkt oder eine tragbare Dienstleistung zu starten. So wie Amazon es für kleine und mittlere Unternehmen (KMU) getan hat, hoffen wir auch, das Unternehmertum weiter zu demokratisieren, indem wir Studenten frühzeitig dazu inspirieren, ihr Potenzial als Unternehmer der Zukunft zu erkunden.
Mentorin bei BUILD zu sein, war eine sehr beeindruckende und aufschlussreiche Erfahrung. Es ist unglaublich zu sehen, mit welcher Leidenschaft ein Konzept in ein Produkt umgesetzt wird, auf das die Schüler stolz sind. Die Arbeit bei Thrasio gibt mir das Selbstvertrauen, diesen Studenten zu sagen, dass es eine Welt gibt, die ihren Unternehmergeist schätzt und ihre Lösungsfähigkeiten braucht.
Die Möglichkeit, meiner eigenen Mittelschule etwas zurückzugeben, war eine unglaubliche berufliche Leistung, die auch für mich persönlich sehr wichtig ist. Ich bin begeistert, dass ich in den Gemeinden, in denen ich aufgewachsen bin, etwas bewirken kann, und dass ich klugen jungen Köpfen neue Karrieremöglichkeiten eröffnen kann.
Wir ermutigen die Thrasher, unsere Politik der unbegrenzten bezahlten Freistellung zu nutzen und sich für die Themen einzusetzen, die ihnen am wichtigsten sind.
Machen Sie sich mit einer Gruppe positiver Menschen auf, die Zukunft zu gestalten.

Trotz anfänglichen Erfolgen konnte die Marke aufgrund von externen Faktoren und mangelnden Ressourcen jedoch nie ihr volles Potenzial entfalten. Das brachte das Team auf eine Idee: Könnte man angeschlagene E-Commerce-Shops aufkaufen und diese mit Hilfe von skalierbaren Prozessen in die nächste Liga befördern?

Through our Responsible Sourcing Program, we partner with amfori, the leading global business association for open and sustainable trade, to implement tools and best practices that evaluate the social performance of our supply chain. Suppliers are committed to follow the amfori code of conduct – 11 principles ranging from fair payments to environmental protection.
As part of our Supply Chain Sustainability initiative, we’ve adopted the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol standard to measure, manage, and report our GHG emissions. We've also partnered with Pathzero to estimate GHG emissions from port-to-port freight operations, following best practices as specified in the Protocol.
To strengthen the communities in which we live and work, we’ve created meaningful, fun, and high-engagement mentorship and philanthropic opportunities.
Thrasio’s fellowship in collaboration with Success Academy (SA) in Harlem offers high school students the opportunity to learn from our employees how to research, build, and scale a social enterprise from scratch. Fellows work in teams and, after a series of workshops, are awarded seed funding to launch a minimum viable product or service in their communities. As Amazon has done for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), we also hope to further democratize entrepreneurship by inspiring students early on to explore their potential as the entrepreneurs of the future.
Being a mentor at BUILD has been a very humbling and eye-opening experience. It is incredible to see the passion that goes into developing a concept into a product that the students are proud of. Working at Thrasio gives me the confidence to tell these students that there is a world that values their entrepreneurial spirits and needs their problem-solving skills.
Being able to give back to my own middle school was an incredible professional accomplishment that’s also very important to me personally. I’m thrilled to be able to impact the communities where I grew up and to potentially introduce new career possibilities for bright young minds.
We encourage Thrashers to utilize our unlimited paid time off policy and take action on issues that are most meaningful to them.
Take off with a group of positive people out to define the future.

Some say fortune favors the brave. Josh and Carlos’ good fortune started when they met while working on a purpose-driven jewelry brand called Bravelets, founded by current Thrasio COO Stephanie Fox. Though the company was initially successful, environmental factors and a lack of resources kept it from growing to its maximum potential. This gave them an idea: What if they could roll up struggling ecommerce companies into one portfolio and use a single set of operators and scalable processes to take them to the next level? Talk about entering a brave new world. Together, they disrupted the 3P marketplace on Amazon and established a category that has gone on to inspire hundreds of competitors.

We bring products people love to the world.
At Thrasio, we’re reimagining how to make the world’s most-loved products accessible to everyone. So we work with successful sellers, using a deep understanding of rankings, ratings, and reviews – plus supply chain and marketing smarts – to transform the art and science of commerce.
We now feel like stronger business owners because we have a solid model for structuring any future brands we build—and can count on Thrasio to have our backs at any time.
I love how quickly Thrasio can move, how fair they are with their valuation, and how well they aligned with our vision. I returned to Thrasio to sell my second and third businesses.
Thrasio was able to consistently keep revenue strong through 2020 despite the numerous manufacturing, logistic, fulfillment constraints so many sellers faced during COVID. I don’t doubt they handled the account better than I could have myself given the same challenges.
Take a page from Thrasio’s playbook.
Actually, take 50 pages.
Get our book on getting your business ready for sale.
We make sure every Thrasio product delivered to your door delivers. And not just once, but every time, helping you make the most of every moment. It’s how we’ve become one of Amazon’s top 5 sellers.
If you’re looking to sell your Amazon business, we’re excited to work together.

Wer wagt, gewinnt. Josh Silberstein und Carlos Cashman verkörpern dieses Motto. Die beiden Thrasio Gründer trafen sich bei der Arbeit an einer Kampagne für die Schmuckmarke Bravelets von Stephanie Fox, die heute COO bei Thrasio ist. Trotz anfänglichen Erfolgen konnte die Marke aufgrund von externen Faktoren und mangelnden Ressourcen jedoch nie ihr volles Potenzial entfalten. Das brachte das Team auf eine Idee: Könnte man angeschlagene E-Commerce-Shops aufkaufen und diese mit Hilfe von skalierbaren Prozessen in die nächste Liga befördern? Gemeinsam wagten sie sich auf ein völlig neues Terrain vor. Dabei haben sie nicht nur den Amazon-Markt für Dritt-Anbieter aufgemischt, sondern eine komplett neue Branche geschaffen, deren Erfolg hunderte von Wettbewerbern hervorgebracht hat.

Während Thrasio expandiert, arbeiten wir hart daran, dass unser globales Bewusstsein noch schneller wächst. Unser Einfluss auf die Umwelt und die Gemeinden hilft uns bei der Entscheidungsfindung.
Im Rahmen unseres Programms für verantwortungsbewusste Beschaffung arbeiten wir mit dem weltweit führenden Wirtschaftsverband für offenen und nachhaltigen Handel amfori zusammen, um Instrumente und bewährte Verfahren zur Bewertung der sozialen Leistung unserer Lieferkette einzuführen. Die Lieferanten verpflichten sich, den amfori-Verhaltenskodex zu folgen, der 11 Grundsätze umfasst: von fairer Bezahlung bis zum Umweltschutz.
Im Rahmen unserer Initiative zur Nachhaltigkeit in der Lieferkette haben wir den Standard des Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol übernommen, um unsere Treibhausgasemissionen zu messen, zu verwalten und zu melden. Darüber hinaus haben wir uns mit Pathzero zusammengetan, um die GHG-Emissionen von Port-to-Port-Frachtgeschäften anhand der im Protokoll festgelegten Best Practices einzuschätzen.
Um die Gemeinschaften, in denen wir leben und arbeiten, zu stärken, haben wir bedeutsame, unterhaltsame und wirkungsvolle Mentoring- und philanthropische Möglichkeiten geschaffen.
Das Stipendium von Thrasio in Zusammenarbeit mit der Success Academy (SA) in Harlem bietet High-School-Schülern die Möglichkeit, von unseren Mitarbeitern zu lernen, wie man ein soziales Unternehmen von Grund auf recherchiert, aufbaut und erweitert. Stipendiaten arbeiten in Teams und werden nach mehreren Workshops mit Seed-Finanzierung belohnt, um in ihren Communitys mindestens ein akzeptables Produkt oder eine tragbare Dienstleistung zu starten. So wie Amazon es für kleine und mittlere Unternehmen (KMU) getan hat, hoffen wir auch, das Unternehmertum weiter zu demokratisieren, indem wir Studenten frühzeitig dazu inspirieren, ihr Potenzial als Unternehmer der Zukunft zu erkunden.
Mentorin bei BUILD zu sein, war eine sehr beeindruckende und aufschlussreiche Erfahrung. Es ist unglaublich zu sehen, mit welcher Leidenschaft ein Konzept in ein Produkt umgesetzt wird, auf das die Schüler stolz sind. Die Arbeit bei Thrasio gibt mir das Selbstvertrauen, diesen Studenten zu sagen, dass es eine Welt gibt, die ihren Unternehmergeist schätzt und ihre Lösungsfähigkeiten braucht.
Die Möglichkeit, meiner eigenen Mittelschule etwas zurückzugeben, war eine unglaubliche berufliche Leistung, die auch für mich persönlich sehr wichtig ist. Ich bin begeistert, dass ich in den Gemeinden, in denen ich aufgewachsen bin, etwas bewirken kann, und dass ich klugen jungen Köpfen neue Karrieremöglichkeiten eröffnen kann.

As Thrasio expands across the world, we are committed to growing our global consciousness even faster. Our impact on the environment and the opportunity to lift people up help guide every decision we make.
Through our Responsible Sourcing Program, we partner with amfori, the leading global business association for open and sustainable trade, to implement tools and best practices that evaluate the social performance of our supply chain. Suppliers are committed to follow the amfori code of conduct – 11 principles ranging from fair payments to environmental protection.
As part of our Supply Chain Sustainability initiative, we’ve adopted the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol standard to measure, manage, and report our GHG emissions. We've also partnered with Pathzero to estimate GHG emissions from port-to-port freight operations, following best practices as specified in the Protocol.
To strengthen the communities in which we live and work, we’ve created meaningful, fun, and high-engagement mentorship and philanthropic opportunities.
Thrasio’s fellowship in collaboration with Success Academy (SA) in Harlem offers high school students the opportunity to learn from our employees how to research, build, and scale a social enterprise from scratch. Fellows work in teams and, after a series of workshops, are awarded seed funding to launch a minimum viable product or service in their communities. As Amazon has done for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), we also hope to further democratize entrepreneurship by inspiring students early on to explore their potential as the entrepreneurs of the future.
Being a mentor at BUILD has been a very humbling and eye-opening experience. It is incredible to see the passion that goes into developing a concept into a product that the students are proud of. Working at Thrasio gives me the confidence to tell these students that there is a world that values their entrepreneurial spirits and needs their problem-solving skills.
Being able to give back to my own middle school was an incredible professional accomplishment that’s also very important to me personally. I’m thrilled to be able to impact the communities where I grew up and to potentially introduce new career possibilities for bright young minds.
We encourage Thrashers to utilize our unlimited paid time off policy and take action on issues that are most meaningful to them.
Take off with a group of positive people out to define the future.

Our leadership team is made up of Amazon veterans, e-commerce connoisseurs and successful entrepreneurs who are at the forefront of rethinking the way products are brought to the world.
Wer wagt, gewinnt. Josh Silberstein und Carlos Cashman verkörpern dieses Motto. Die beiden Thrasio Gründer trafen sich bei der Arbeit an einer Kampagne für die Schmuckmarke Bravelets von Stephanie Fox, die heute COO bei Thrasio ist. Trotz anfänglichen Erfolgen konnte die Marke aufgrund von externen Faktoren und mangelnden Ressourcen jedoch nie ihr volles Potenzial entfalten. Das brachte das Team auf eine Idee: Könnte man angeschlagene E-Commerce-Shops aufkaufen und diese mit Hilfe von skalierbaren Prozessen in die nächste Liga befördern? Gemeinsam wagten sie sich auf ein völlig neues Terrain vor. Dabei haben sie nicht nur den Amazon-Markt für Dritt-Anbieter aufgemischt, sondern eine komplett neue Branche geschaffen, deren Erfolg hunderte von Wettbewerbern hervorgebracht hat.

Some say fortune favors the brave. Josh and Carlos’ good fortune started when they met while working on a purpose-driven jewelry brand called Bravelets, founded by current Thrasio COO Stephanie Fox. Though the company was initially successful, environmental factors and a lack of resources kept it from growing to its maximum potential. This gave them an idea: What if they could roll up struggling ecommerce companies into one portfolio and use a single set of operators and scalable processes to take them to the next level? Talk about entering a brave new world. Together, they disrupted the 3P marketplace on Amazon and established a category that has gone on to inspire hundreds of competitors.

Three of our brand owners share hot takes and takeaways after logging huge sales during Amazon’s fall event.
from Amazon’s Prime Early Access Sale (“PEAS”) is revealing that the products with big sales didn’t come with big price tags. For Thrasio, this meant the event and many of our brands went together like PEAS and carrots, with several of those brands having their best days yet.
In our new Q&A series “Best in Thras,” we teased out some reflections on PEAS with three questions for three Thrashers whose brands cooked the competition.
. It snatched a top spot in Lightning Deals and reached #2 best-seller status in pet supplies.
136,440 hours of colorful dancing flames keeping customers warm this winter.
™ glow-in-the-dark basketballs, footballs, and soccer balls. All three products simultaneously held the #1 best-seller spot during the sale, and the brand absolutely crushed it with sales 1,000% bigger than July’s Prime Day, for its biggest Prime Day yet.
Why was your brand successful during this event?
Choosing an attractive price point for our customers helps a lot.
In addition, we were able to obtain a lot of affiliate assistance for external traffic while leveraging coupons.
: We ran three Lightning Deals on the top Magical Flames listings, stacking them with coupons and exclusive discounts for affiliate/influencer partners, to create attractive final price points for our customers across all pack sizes. Additionally, leading into PEAS, we launched 600+ new Amazon PPC campaigns, which drove rank and sessions on key upper funnel keywords.
: We leaned into the available Amazon promotions, ran analysis of deals on those promotional prices, and had great discounts at a great time of year. Soccer, football and basketball seasons are all starting, it’s getting darker outside earlier and GlowCity is a great gift for the holidays.
How will you extend and/or learn from that success to have a strong Turkey 5?
: We will continue to push for brand recognition off of Amazon by working with affiliates, running Facebook ads, and leveraging TikTok – as well as YouTube soon.
for conversions and brand recognition while running a Top Deal. We are also making sure we are positioned with enough inventory to sell through November, December, and deals.
: Given the historical “stocking stuffer” appeal for Magical Flames, we will lean heavily into this theme heading into T5 via strategic copy updates, paid traffic campaigns, and affiliate/influencer coverage. Improving brand exposure for Magical Flames on these search terms will enable our Turkey 5 Lightning Deals to reach a larger set of customers. Furthermore, we will look beyond Turkey 5 to continue offering attractive deals up until the Christmas delivery cutoff.
: Inventory is not unlimited, so we’ll set specific deal unit limits to maintain healthy inventory throughout Q4.
On T5, a deal can really take off, which is great. But you want to make sure you leave inventory to capture higher margin sales from the “halo” effect of deals. On GlowCity, our sales were up nearly 100 percent the week following PEAS compared to the week before.
What piece of advice would you give to sellers coming out of PEAS?
: Leverage coupons and price your product to sell during high traffic events. Then ride the algorithm spike wave at a higher price point.
: Do not undersell the power of deal and coupon stacking when trying to improve your deals page placement. Stacked coupons may not be visible on the deals page, but they positively impact conversion, which bodes well with Amazon’s ranking algorithm.
: Nothing too extraordinary here; run some final optimization tests over the next few weeks (creative, copy, etc.), work to have strong keyword rank the week leading into T5, and utilize the promotions Amazon offers. Choose the promotions that match the goals for your products – promotions have varying discounts and expected lifts.

------------------------
External traffic is critical to boosting sales and revenue from your Amazon listings. Measuring its performance is simple with this solution.
Rising PPC costs. Shifting consumer behavior. Increased competition. Just when you think you’ve got a handle on the best marketing strategy to drive sales to your Amazon FBA business, a new challenge pops up like some twisted game of Whac-A-Mole. That’s why it’s never been more important to have a comprehensive strategy that meets consumers wherever they are and is capable of handling new tests and surprises.
or preparing to sell, this tool will make your marketing efforts more fruitful and possibly increase the valuation of your company.
What is Amazon Attribution?
. Amazon Attribution is a solution created by Amazon to serve a similar need: the measurement of marketing channel performance on your site; in this case, that refers to non-Amazon marketing channel performance on your Amazon listing.
As you might know, advertisers are unable to place tracking pixels on their Amazon listings – so this tool is key to tracking your marketing performance. While still in beta, Amazon Attribution has been around for some time. It allows you to append URL parameters to your ads and pass information like campaign, ad group, channel, and publisher to the attribution console. This allows you to measure detailed product views (DPVs), add to carts (ATCs), units sold, total revenue, and more from your external traffic campaigns.
In addition to informing better ad spend decisions, Amazon Attribution ensures you have line of sight into conversions, which are paramount to ranking well in organic Amazon searches. Driving too much non-converting traffic to your listing risks hurting your Amazon SEO performance. In addition, advertisers receive a referral bonus from Amazon for every sale they generate via Amazon Attribution (more on this later).
.
From here you have two options: create the campaign manually or upload a file to create in bulk.
We recommend leveraging the bulk file creation flow if you’re starting with a paid search campaign. If you’re testing a paid social campaign you can use the manual creation flow.
Once you have the template you’ll want to create your campaign in the Google Ads editor and post it to Google/Bing as paused. From there you’ll need to download your keywords from Google and input the data into the bulk upload template columns below. Next, add the products you’d like to track in the products section.
Once the final URL suffix is added you’re ready to launch your campaign! There are also third-party tools that automate this process, but the manual flow is a great place to start if you’re using attribution for the first time.
As with any marketing tool, Amazon Attribution does have limitations. It’s important to note that once a campaign is launched it takes two full days for sales data to backfill completely. Because of this, we recommend ramping up campaigns gradually so you can optimize based on conversion data before really scaling up.
Amazon Attribution also uses a last-click attribution model with a 14-day look-back window. This model gives full credit for a sale or conversion to the touchpoint a customer last clicked on or engaged with before making a purchase. This is critical to keep in mind when analyzing campaign performance, because single-touch attribution models only tell part of the story.
Finally, to maintain user privacy Amazon masks conversion data for keywords that have not met the required daily click threshold. The banner below will indicate if you’re experiencing conversion masking in your campaigns.
This click threshold is cumulative, which means that viewing conversion data at the campaign level will provide the most accurate conversion amount for your campaigns. The click threshold is small but must be met for conversion data to appear. Conversions will not show at the ad group level if the particular ad group has not met that daily click threshold.
. On average, brands can earn a 10 percent bonus from qualifying sales simply by signing up. To calculate how much you may receive, multiply your qualifying sales from the relevant product category by the corresponding minimum bonus rate in the table below. Amazon now includes this amount in the reporting section of Attribution.
There is a two-month waiting period to receive the credit to your account, which accommodates order cancellations and customer returns. This bonus can really add up over time: one of our products, for example, generated $60k in referral bonus money over a seven-month period. The cherry on top? The bonus money also helps make leveraging external traffic easier for low-margin products.
Amazon Attribution is an easy tool to learn and a powerful way to keep growing your FBA business. The time you put into using it will easily pay off in the long run. Whether you’re currently running external campaigns or are planning to in the future, make sure to use it to track your sales.

When you’re looking for meaty advice as a CPG company owner, you don’t want the cheap cuts. You want the top of the line. Good news: We’re kicking off our webinars with Prime ... Day guidance.
sold worldwide and $3 billion spent on products from third-party small businesses. Many brands on the marketplace killed it, even if the macroeconomic uncertainty had some questioning their early strategy and decision-making. Now Amazon’s gearing up for another Prime Day in October – so, can lightning (deals) strike twice?
On Wednesday, Sept. 28, in the first episode of our new webinar series “For Your Own Goods,” three of Thrasio’s brand owners will help you prepare for another epic Amazon “holiday,” sharing insights from the successes they saw in July and advice on how your company can prepare for the sequel – or ride the wave and set the table for the Turkey 5.
We know what you’re thinking: Can you help me up my turkey game before November?
Scratch that: How will this webinar be different from the rest?
Host Sabina Raja, who shepherds the Zober brand of our YH Goods product line, will lead a conversation covering a wide range of topics with fellow brand owners Corey Gaarn and Will Moffett.
pillows over this summer’s event, Gaarn was instrumental to the bedding brand attaining 474% YOY sales growth, Amazon home page placement, and several editorial endorsements. The ChomChom pet hair roller, meanwhile, was also on the home page as a No. 1 trending deal and overall leader in the pet category, thanks to the work of Moffett and team members. They each bring a wealth of tactical knowledge on how to optimize your operations and sell at scale.
Sellers, come prepared to take notes and ask questions, because this discussion will hit on a number of learnings and key takeaways that can either be used over the next couple weeks or as part of a longer-term gameplan.
from 2-3 p.m. EDT Sept. 28 for this inaugural webinar and experience a taste of what’s in store “For Your Own Goods.” Our series will feature both internal Thrasio team members and external sellers talking about timely topics, providing advice on how to pivot when challenges arise, and breaking down the best long-term plans to grow your brand.

https://www.thrasio.com/resources/blog/secrets-to-omnichannel-and-retail
------------------------
Reeling in ecommerce sales takes skill. But to tackle new markets, you need new tools in your box. Our sales chief helps you cast a wider net.
Your megahit coffee frother nabbed the Amazon Best Seller Badge moooonths ago. In fact, your whole line of coffee products are buzzworthy category leaders. Revenue is up and so are your margins. Impressive? You bet. But your growth doesn’t have to stop there.
For businesses at the peak of their Amazon game, the next step is brewing up a strong omnichannel strategy.
What is omnichannel?
People often use the term “omnichannel” when they’re simply selling products through multiple marketplaces and channels – Amazon, direct to consumer (DTC), retail, and maybe social commerce. But the endgame for a true omnichannel strategy is complete integration, so that your markets, sales data, the customer experience, and the brand are all part of one intelligent ecosystem. Each piece plays a role in lifting the business and delivers a personalized experience to the customer.
notes that over 85% of shopping is still happening in physical stores.
Is your brand retail ready?
Your product has to be unique.
at a great price.
You need a gross profit margin of at least 50%.
Wholesaling can yield excellent gross margins – and more control over those margins. You set your price, and (in general) it sticks, which makes it different from selling through Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), says Esposito. “It’s not a daily battle to fix your price against your competitors’ pricing, which can lead you to a dangerous race to the bottom.” You’re also not paying FBA fees or pouring money into pay-per-click ads to get eyes on your product page. But you will be fulfilling your own wholesale orders and complying with unique terms associated with major retail. You’ll incur more operating costs due to shipping errors, product returns, payment terms, and many unique service requirements by retailer. So you’ve got to be able to maintain healthy profit margins before considering a run at retail.
Assume you’re going to sell your product to retailers at a wholesale price that is a 50% discount from your full FBA retail. Depending on the category of the product, that’s a good rule of thumb (also known as keystone pricing).
Do your research.
For certain categories, like cleaning supplies, there are more than a dozen national retailers that could sell your product. In other categories, like toys, you may only be able to place your product with three or four retailers – saturating your opportunities fairly quickly.
To test the waters, think about what kind of store you want your product to be in and why. What else is on the shelves in that store? What makes your product different from those other brands? What customers are you trying to reach? And why is your product going to make a difference in their lives?
The answers to these questions are going to guide your retail strategy – what stores you’re going after and how you’re going to craft your pitch to their buyers (but more on that later).
What are the drawbacks?
Supply chain is different for retail. You need to partner with a third-party logistics (3PL) company that can fulfill retail and have a systems infrastructure that connects you seamlessly to your 3PL and customer. You’ll be challenged to meet different compliance regulations or standards for both your products and packaging – and again, these challenges can and will differ by retailer. This may require legal advice or design expertise. Traditional retail triggers a fundamentally different operating structure than an FBA brand.
Managing supply chain and inventory is one of the biggest challenges of moving from FBA to an in-store environment. In retail in particular, stocking out is just not an option. Empty shelves are a retailer’s money-losing nightmare. If you miss orders, you could be hit with hefty chargebacks that could sink your brand, not to mention your reputation among buyers. If you become a headache for a buyer, you’ll lose their business for good.
In retail, people really do shop with their eyes first, which also means you need a great packaging designer who gets the voice of your brand and can make your product stand out on store shelves. The retail shopper is confronted by a sea of products and packaging, and you have a split second to attract their attention and highlight the uniqueness of your product!
So how do you get your products in front of buyers?
According to Esposito, there are a few ways you can get your foot in the door with retailers.
First, attend trade shows for your category. Say you’re in the pet category. Just start Googling “top pet retail trade shows,” find one that looks like it suits your product best, and sign up. You’ll meet a lot of mom and pop buyers, but you’ll also build your network and learn from other attendees. Esposito also recommends setting up an account on faire.com, which is like an Amazon for wholesalers.
Another approach would be to contact a manufacturer’s representative. Again, a Google search will bring up a number of experienced representatives who know the industry and have established relationships with the buyers you’re trying to get your product in front of. They tend to work on a 5% commission for major accounts, but the cost might be well worth the guidance they provide. You can also meet these reps at trade shows or through referrals.
Lastly, try good old-fashioned cold calling. If you have a successful “digitally native” brand and can tout a category leadership position with great reviews, most retail merchants will give you a look. Bombard them with samples and category knowledge and they may be your next best friend!
When an omnichannel strategy is firing on all cylinders, all the channels synergistically play a role in lifting overall sales and building brand equity. “We call it the flywheel effect,” says Esposito.
. The pet odor eliminator spray is on the shelves of many Target and PetSmart stores. Someone shopping for dog food in Target may see a bottle of Angry Orange pet odor eliminator and not initially buy it. But later, when they’re searching for pet odor eliminator products on their phone and Angry Orange appears with an average customer review rating of 4.4 out of 5 stars, the customer knows it’s a trusted brand. After they pull the trigger on a purchase, we can then retarget that customer for additional purchases of Angry Orange products through ads on Amazon and Google.
We first brought Angry Orange to a few hardware stores. Products flew off the shelves, and we were able to share that success as proof positive that Angry Orange could make money for other national retailers.
If you’re a top seller in your category, chances are you’ve got a great product. And getting that product into as many hands as possible means meeting customers where they are – on their computers, their phones, and yes – in brick-and-mortar stores too.

By selling quality hammocks at an affordable price, Wise Owl founder Sarah Douglass hopes to help people make more lasting memories in nature.
, Sarah Douglass, remembers the day that she and her husband, Todd, walked out of a national outdoors retailer with all the equipment they needed for a backpacking trip – and an eye-popping receipt for $2,500.
That bothered her. A lot.
To Sarah, nature was a place for restoration and rejuvenation. She felt that everyone should be able to experience that – and the price of admission to the Great Outdoors, by her calculation, should be as close as possible to free.
Plenty of people have thoughts like these. But most people don’t have the ability, tenacity, or audacity to act on those ideas, much less see them through to completion.

Her family went to Hawaii once — the only “real” vacation they ever took. Other than that, it was twice-yearly trips to the Strawberry Music Festival in Camp Mather near Yosemite. Families pitched tents or strung hammocks between the pines. There was folk and bluegrass music and jam sessions going all day and night. Kids roamed the woods and spent hours swimming and crafting. The whole experience ended with a Sunday revival at Birch Lake. For her, the festival was the pinnacle of childhood happiness; for her family, it also happened to be a vacation that was pretty close to free.
Around 18, Sarah briefly decided to try her hand at school again. She became pregnant. And that was that. She started a new chapter as a single parent, working 2 or 3 jobs at a time to raise her son. Of course, it was hard.
Sarah spent plenty of years working for other people. A pattern emerged. She’d learn the business until she could pretty much run the business, then she’d ask for a big raise, and walk if she didn’t get one. She walked a few times. She was good at working, liked working – it was the working “for other people” part that needed changing. Along the way, Sarah met her now-husband, Todd, who shared a similar set of values, including a desire to strike out and build a business they could call their own.
But hammocks were a no-fuss piece of equipment that represented happiness to Sarah. Within a few minutes, people could be set up, relaxing, and listening to the gurgle of a stream, ocean waves, or a breeze in the trees. Hammocks were a way to get people enjoying nature fast, easy, and on the cheap.
Hammocks, as a product, also had some clear business advantages: they were relatively simple to manufacture and their compact size made them economical to ship. The fabric color and style options were endless, so they could always be on trend as customer tastes changed. Plus, Wise Owl could produce a lot of hammock accessories to eventually expand its product line.
From the stitching thread counts to the way the seams felt on bare skin (after all, customers might be using a hammock while wearing shorts or a swimsuit), Sarah and Todd left no detail unexamined.
Of the low-cost models, none passed the Sarah test. Too scratchy, too small, poorly made, too difficult to set up. She found one she did love – but it came with a nearly $100 price tag.
They had a mission for their new Amazon ecommerce business: Make the greatest hammock anyone ever owned at half the price.
When she was dreaming up the Wise Owl brand, Sarah created a script for a video ad. In her storyboards, she would proffer a Wise Owl hammock toward the camera and explain to viewers that what she was holding in her hand was not in fact a hammock at all… but happiness. Wise Owl was selling the feeling she had in childhood, what she wanted everyone to experience themselves.
In 2015, Sarah and Todd drew down their savings to place her first purchase order of 200 hammocks. The day the products arrived on her doorstep was another lesson in the challenges of building an Amazon ecommerce business. She opened the box and … the Wise Owl logo was the wrong color. Even worse, the hammocks were stuffed into long and skinny carrying sacks. “They were basically two-foot-long sausages,” she says. She pulled them all apart and paid a local seamstress to fix every logo patch and every sack.
Today, Wise Owl is a booming online Amazon ecommerce business. The hammocks are nearing 40,000 ratings and maintain an impressive average of 4.8. Wise Owl has earned dual Best Seller Badges in both the camping hammocks and patio hammocks categories, while its camping pillows and hammock bug net also have Best Seller Badges. In 2021 alone, the brand sold hundreds of thousands of units in its product line. At the end of 2021, the Camping Hammock was capturing the majority of the market share for camping hammocks on Amazon.
hammocks will launch in the Canadian, UK, and German Amazon markets – a huge expansion for what started as a small Amazon ecommerce business.

------------------------
Every company has growing pains. To maintain a healthy outlook for your brand's future, don't overlook these key action items.
To strengthen the health of your FBA brand, it can pay to look beyond the bottom line. Have you grown a solid base of happy repeat customers? Or earned an avalanche of 5-star Amazon reviews for your products?  These are the kind of success markers that don’t directly appear on a profit and loss statement — but they can translate into higher customer lifetime value and a stronger FBA brand. In other words, to build an FBA brand with staying power, it helps to consider the big picture of your business.
Here are 4 strategies to think about.
If you’re used to thinking only about profit margin, you may want to start thinking about profit-dollars as well. Your goal should be to improve conversion rates and sales velocity on the products that provide the most bang for the buck in profit-dollars.
Conversion share is the number of times customers bought your product after searching with a given keyword, divided by the total number of times customers bought any product after searching with that same keyword. You want this number to grow over time. It shows you’re capturing a bigger slice of the pie linked to keywords associated with your product.
. The report is a gold mine of insights about your category and your FBA business.
to see which images perform best.
And yes, go for the video. A lot of people don’t incorporate video because it seems too hard or complex. Think of this: we’ve made very professional marketing videos with celebrities that have cost tens of thousands of dollars – and in some scenarios, those convert less than something made in 20 minutes on an iPhone. The lesson? It doesn’t have to be an insane production to be successful. It just needs to connect with customers.
Reviews are the lifeblood of an Amazon ecommerce business. You know this. When faced with an array of similar products, customers often default to the one with the most positive reviews. High-quality reviews start with a high-quality product, of course, but after that, you’ll need to do a little more work to earn your stars.
The work is well worth it. You want to create a moat of positive reviews around your products – an unbridgeable gap between your well-loved products and those of your closest competitors. And to increase your volume of positive reviews, you’ll need to increase your volume of sales. This may mean selling at a loss via a temporary price cut, running Amazon Deals, or increasing ad spending to boost traffic.

Lifelong Online’s co-founders built a powerhouse brand that put a dent in India’s appliance market. The secret to their success? Listen to who matters most – the customer.
market for ecommerce businesses. To be successful, brands must navigate the complexities of India’s delivery infrastructure. They also need to understand the diverse needs of Indian customers, what they want, how they shop, and what they value. In a country of 1.4 billion people, that is extraordinarily difficult.
Which is why the team charged with leading Thrasio’s foray into India are people who know what it takes to build a successful ecommerce brand there.
“It’s our customers, their stories, and their experiences with our products that really inspire me,” says Bharat Kalia, one the three co-founders and CEO of Lifelong Online (now called Lifelong, a Thrasio Company).
Kalia founded Lifelong in 2015 with two partners – Atul Raheja and Varun Grover. Since then, they’ve created more than 100 products, primarily in the kitchen-and-home, and health-and-fitness categories. Air fryers, stoves, stand mixers, treadmills, massagers, hair straighteners: a Lifelong product can be found in about a million homes in more than 500 cities.
The three founders of India-based company Lifelong, a Thrasio company.
But perhaps its biggest triumph is how Lifelong boldly entered the appliance market – a notoriously difficult category dominated by large, entrenched brands. “The products I was using in my home were the same my parents used,” Kalia says.
can be tucked behind a couch or under a bed – the ultimate solution for health-conscious Indians living in space-challenged homes. Today it is one of the best-selling products in the Lifelong line.
Or consider the case of Lifelong’s early version bicycle. Customers were frustrated with how much time and effort it took to put together. “People were saying ‘This is the hardest thing I ever did,’” Kalia says. The next version had just 5 moving parts and came 90% pre-assembled. Now they’re on version 3.
The customer is both king and queen at Lifelong.
A new product launch can involve 2 or 3 interactions with customers in a month, conversations that are coded and analyzed to ensure products are delivering happiness and satisfaction. “We analyze a ton of data and carefully codify our questions before making customer calls,” Kalia says.
This extraordinary openness to feedback goes back to Lifelong’s very first product, an oven toaster griller. In their enthusiasm, Kalia and the founders mounted a product listing before the product was actually ready. “We were super happy to get our first order,” Kalia says. “The problem was we only had a prototype.” He gave the customer a heads-up that the product was a bit of a work in progress – and then packed it up and mailed it across the country to the customer.
in less than prime condition. (“Basically, it was mangled,” Kalia says.) After multiple calls with the customer, Kalia delivered a new model to the customer within 2 weeks. After all that, the customer left Lifelong a positive review.
Lifelong’s employees hard at work building a next generation consumer goods company in India. Thrasio bought a majority share in Lifelong in January.
Lifelong’s goal of reaching every household in a country of 1.4 billion people will require keeping a careful eye on how the market is changing. People aren’t as tied to legacy brands as they once were, Kalia says, and younger generations are more comfortable with ecommerce.

, your gateway to building a better consumer goods company. Every edition, we’ll share stories, insights, and expertise on a topic critical to the industry. This issue: the importance of quality assurance and making sure the products you deliver truly deliver.
Your customers expect the best. Here are 5 steps to build a strong quality assurance program and become more effective at preventing the defective.
Everyone’s been there. You buy a product that you’re excited to use, and then, when you need it, it fails to live up to its claims. Total headache. But for a business owner, one defective item can potentially set off a torrent of torment: a batch that has to be recalled, poor reviews that affect customer acquisition and loyalty, and even additional rounds of production. Fortunately, a strong quality assurance program can save the day, catching defective products before they ever ship to your customers.
If you don’t have a program in place, fear not: Axel Gonzalez has your back. Thrasio’s senior director of quality assurance and sustainability shares 5 steps to get you started.
Take, for example, the premium 10-piece bartender set Thrasio sells through our Mixology & Craft brand. It’s a showpiece with a premium price point. As such, its form can’t have scratches, dirty marks, or any flaws in its shape. Its strainer has to snugly fit inside the shaker so that no liquid leaks, while each piece must also fit in the display stand. And in order to meet Mixology & Craft’s goal of creating delicious cocktails, the shakers need to function as closed vessels that allow you to quickly mix ingredients together while simultaneously chilling the drink. This bartender set needs to bring your dreams of perfect libations to life.
Take some time to think about how form, fit, and function apply to your products. Literally make a list. This is the start of your quality assurance program, how you’ll begin to understand which attributes need to be assessed and tested. Depending on the complexity of your product, it could be a long list. But by clearly identifying what really matters to your products early on, you’ll set yourself up for a smooth operation and strong defense against trouble down the road.
Once you’ve decided what you’re going to test for, you need a resource to guide you through the process. Enter the quality acceptance document.
“The quality acceptance document is essentially the playbook that you will use to carry out your product inspections,” Gonzalez notes.
Picture a playbook for an NFL team. At its most basic, you’ll have your coaching staff and players (or, who’s leading and conducting the testing process), your schedule (how often you test), and your gameplan (how you’ll conduct tests). Instead of using Xs and Os and other visual aids to run your plays, however, you’ll use pictures that help you tell which products will pass a quality check, which will fail, and why. The playbook will also outline the sample sizes you’ll test and define what percentage of defective products will signal the need to reject a whole batch.
Use your written explanation of ideal form, fit, and function to identify what imperfections to test for. These will fall into 1 of 3 categories: minor defect, major defect, or critical defect. For example, a scratch on a cocktail shaker might be considered a minor defect, while a warped shaker that doesn’t fit inside the other shaker could be deemed a critical defect. The amount of defects you find in your sample size will give you an idea about whether you can ship your products, need to do additional testing, or have to – sigh – reject the batch outright.
You can then come up with your own sample sizes and rejection thresholds, but the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) also has a standardized acceptance quality limit (AQL) sampling system for inspection by attributes. The AQL chart can be used to provide information and guidance on inspection levels, rejection thresholds, and sample sizes for individual shipments.
If this seems like a lot, it doesn’t have to be. You don’t want to go it alone when creating a quality acceptance document. Incorporate your supplier into the process.
“It only makes sense that your supplier agrees to everything in the document so that both parties are on the same page in terms of what is and is not acceptable,” Gonzalez says.
By having quality standards clearly laid out and agreed upon ahead of time, you reduce the risk of having a drawn-out dispute with your supplier over an unsatisfactory batch of product.
Striking the right balance on quality assurance can also be tricky. You have to take a bit of a Goldilocks approach with it. Too strict and you run the risk of rejecting too much product, which can lead to delays and stockouts. Too lax and defective products can end up making their way to customers, paving the way for negative reviews. Knowing early on what is realistic for your supplier to achieve from a quality standpoint can save you a lot of time and money down the road.
Oh … and if you’ve never built a quality acceptance document before, no problem.
Templates to help structure your document are available online.
Gonzalez strongly advises against relying on your manufacturer to carry out product inspections on your behalf. “You want an impartial inspector,” he says. “You need to insist on it. Otherwise, you can be left with a supplier who cuts corners when it comes to quality assurance in the hopes of avoiding rejects.” But, Gonzalez adds, there are a few things to keep in mind when looking for a solid third-party inspection company to partner with.
Third-party inspection companies need to be available on short notice. Our partner promises to have an agent on site and ready to conduct an inspection, anywhere in continental Asia, within 24 hours. This kind of flexibility is invaluable, as it minimizes delays across our vast network of suppliers. But even if you only have a few suppliers, if the past 2 years have taught us anything, it’s that unexpected delays and last-minute changes are a fact of life. Knowing that your third-party inspection company has the flexibility to swiftly react to these changes is a huge value-add.
Find an inspection company with top-notch technology platforms that allow you to quickly and easily access all of your inspection reports across your suppliers in real time. That’s especially helpful if you’ve got a lot of suppliers (and thus a lot of inspection reports).
Your third-party inspection company should be aligned with the material in your quality acceptance document. After all, they’ll be the ones carrying out the inspections. In their reports, data should be presented clearly and succinctly, allowing you to make quick, informed decisions on which products are ready to ship. A good inspection report will begin with a summary of the main findings, followed by detailed information to support those assessments. When vetting third-party inspection companies, it’s not a bad idea to ask them for sample reports to get a feel for how they present data.
Schedule inspections as soon as your products come off the line – the sooner the better. Why? That gives you time to course correct if there’s a problem. You don’t want to be caught with insufficient inventory because of extended retesting time frames or full-batch rejections.
There’s no “one size fits all” approach to quality assurance. Every product is unique. Even 2 sellers who sell a similar product may have different ideas about what quality testing should look like. And that’s OK. You’re taking steps that give your products the best chance to arrive on the doorsteps of your customers – exactly how they expect them to be.

Während Thrasio expandiert, arbeiten wir hart daran, dass unser globales Bewusstsein noch schneller wächst. Unser Einfluss auf die Umwelt und die Gemeinden hilft uns bei der Entscheidungsfindung.
Im Rahmen unseres Programms für verantwortungsbewusste Beschaffung arbeiten wir mit dem weltweit führenden Wirtschaftsverband für offenen und nachhaltigen Handel amfori zusammen, um Instrumente und bewährte Verfahren zur Bewertung der sozialen Leistung unserer Lieferkette einzuführen. Die Lieferanten verpflichten sich, den amfori-Verhaltenskodex zu folgen, der 11 Grundsätze umfasst: von fairer Bezahlung bis zum Umweltschutz.
Im Rahmen unserer Initiative zur Nachhaltigkeit in der Lieferkette haben wir den Standard des Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol übernommen, um unsere Treibhausgasemissionen zu messen, zu verwalten und zu melden. Darüber hinaus haben wir uns mit Pathzero zusammengetan, um die GHG-Emissionen von Port-to-Port-Frachtgeschäften anhand der im Protokoll festgelegten Best Practices einzuschätzen.
Um die Gemeinschaften, in denen wir leben und arbeiten, zu stärken, haben wir bedeutsame, unterhaltsame und wirkungsvolle Mentoring- und philanthropische Möglichkeiten geschaffen.
Das Stipendium von Thrasio in Zusammenarbeit mit der Success Academy (SA) in Harlem bietet High-School-Schülern die Möglichkeit, von unseren Mitarbeitern zu lernen, wie man ein soziales Unternehmen von Grund auf recherchiert, aufbaut und erweitert. Stipendiaten arbeiten in Teams und werden nach mehreren Workshops mit Seed-Finanzierung belohnt, um in ihren Communitys mindestens ein akzeptables Produkt oder eine tragbare Dienstleistung zu starten. So wie Amazon es für kleine und mittlere Unternehmen (KMU) getan hat, hoffen wir auch, das Unternehmertum weiter zu demokratisieren, indem wir Studenten frühzeitig dazu inspirieren, ihr Potenzial als Unternehmer der Zukunft zu erkunden.
Mentorin bei BUILD zu sein, war eine sehr beeindruckende und aufschlussreiche Erfahrung. Es ist unglaublich zu sehen, mit welcher Leidenschaft ein Konzept in ein Produkt umgesetzt wird, auf das die Schüler stolz sind. Die Arbeit bei Thrasio gibt mir das Selbstvertrauen, diesen Studenten zu sagen, dass es eine Welt gibt, die ihren Unternehmergeist schätzt und ihre Lösungsfähigkeiten braucht.
Die Möglichkeit, meiner eigenen Mittelschule etwas zurückzugeben, war eine unglaubliche berufliche Leistung, die auch für mich persönlich sehr wichtig ist. Ich bin begeistert, dass ich in den Gemeinden, in denen ich aufgewachsen bin, etwas bewirken kann, und dass ich klugen jungen Köpfen neue Karrieremöglichkeiten eröffnen kann.
Wir ermutigen die Thrasher, unsere Politik der unbegrenzten bezahlten Freistellung zu nutzen und sich für die Themen einzusetzen, die ihnen am wichtigsten sind.
Machen Sie sich mit einer Gruppe positiver Menschen auf, die Zukunft zu gestalten.

Our leadership team is made up of Amazon veterans, e-commerce connoisseurs and successful entrepreneurs who are at the forefront of rethinking the way products are brought to the world.
Wer wagt, gewinnt. Josh Silberstein und Carlos Cashman verkörpern dieses Motto. Die beiden Thrasio Gründer trafen sich bei der Arbeit an einer Kampagne für die Schmuckmarke Bravelets von Stephanie Fox, die heute COO bei Thrasio ist. Trotz anfänglichen Erfolgen konnte die Marke aufgrund von externen Faktoren und mangelnden Ressourcen jedoch nie ihr volles Potenzial entfalten. Das brachte das Team auf eine Idee: Könnte man angeschlagene E-Commerce-Shops aufkaufen und diese mit Hilfe von skalierbaren Prozessen in die nächste Liga befördern? Gemeinsam wagten sie sich auf ein völlig neues Terrain vor. Dabei haben sie nicht nur den Amazon-Markt für Dritt-Anbieter aufgemischt, sondern eine komplett neue Branche geschaffen, deren Erfolg hunderte von Wettbewerbern hervorgebracht hat.

Wir liefern der Welt die beliebtesten Produkte.
Thrasio erweitert den Horizont im Online-Handel. Wir wollen die beliebtesten Produkte aus aller Welt für jeden erreichbar machen. Hierfür arbeiten wir mit erfolgreichen E-Commerce-Unternehmen und Amazon FBA Sellern und nutzen unsere Expertise als Amazon-Aggregator, um ihre Geschäfte zu skalieren. Dabei setzen wir auf erfahrene Amazon-Experten, umfassende SEO-Kenntnisse, Bewertungen und Rezensionen, bewährte Supply-Chain-Prozesse und innovative Marketingstrategien.
Wir sind bessere Unternehmer geworden, denn jetzt haben wir ein gutes Modell für die Entwicklung weiterer Marken – und wir können uns auf die Unterstützung durch Thrasio jederzeit verlassen.
Ich bin beeindruckt, wie schnell Thrasio ans Werk geht, wie fair ihr Angebot war und wie gut sie mit unserer Unternehmensvision übereinstimmen. Ich habe mein zweites und drittes Geschäft ebenfalls an Thrasio verkauft.
Thrasio war in der Lage, über das Jahr 2020 hinweg konstant hohe Umsatzzahlen zu generieren – und das trotz der zahlreichen COVID-Einschränkungen für Produktion, Logistik und Versand. Für mich besteht kein Zweifel, dass sie diesen Herausforderungen besser als ich gewachsen waren.
Unsere Produkte liefern, was wir versprechen. Mit jeder Lieferung wollen wir Ihre Erwartungen nicht nur erfüllen, sondern übertreffen. Auf diese Weise haben wir uns zu einem der Top 5 Amazon-Seller entwickelt.
Gemeinsam bringen wir Ihre Produkte groß raus.
Die Zeit ist reif, Ihr Amazon-Business zu verkaufen? Wir machen Ihnen den Ausstieg leicht.

We bring products people love to the world.
At Thrasio, we’re reimagining how to make the world’s most-loved products accessible to everyone. So we work with successful sellers, using a deep understanding of rankings, ratings, and reviews – plus supply chain and marketing smarts – to transform the art and science of commerce.
We now feel like stronger business owners because we have a solid model for structuring any future brands we build—and can count on Thrasio to have our backs at any time.
I love how quickly Thrasio can move, how fair they are with their valuation, and how well they aligned with our vision. I returned to Thrasio to sell my second and third businesses.
Thrasio was able to consistently keep revenue strong through 2020 despite the numerous manufacturing, logistic, fulfillment constraints so many sellers faced during COVID. I don’t doubt they handled the account better than I could have myself given the same challenges.
Take a page from Thrasio’s playbook.
Actually, take 50 pages.
Get our book on getting your business ready for sale.
We make sure every Thrasio product delivered to your door delivers. And not just once, but every time, helping you make the most of every moment. It’s how we’ve become one of Amazon’s top 5 sellers.
If you’re looking to sell your Amazon business, we’re excited to work together.

As Thrasio expands across the world, we are committed to growing our global consciousness even faster. Our impact on the environment and the opportunity to lift people up help guide every decision we make.
Through our Responsible Sourcing Program, we partner with amfori, the leading global business association for open and sustainable trade, to implement tools and best practices that evaluate the social performance of our supply chain. Suppliers are committed to follow the amfori code of conduct – 11 principles ranging from fair payments to environmental protection.
As part of our Supply Chain Sustainability initiative, we’ve adopted the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol standard to measure, manage, and report our GHG emissions. We've also partnered with Pathzero to estimate GHG emissions from port-to-port freight operations, following best practices as specified in the Protocol.
To strengthen the communities in which we live and work, we’ve created meaningful, fun, and high-engagement mentorship and philanthropic opportunities.
Thrasio’s fellowship in collaboration with Success Academy (SA) in Harlem offers high school students the opportunity to learn from our employees how to research, build, and scale a social enterprise from scratch. Fellows work in teams and, after a series of workshops, are awarded seed funding to launch a minimum viable product or service in their communities. As Amazon has done for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), we also hope to further democratize entrepreneurship by inspiring students early on to explore their potential as the entrepreneurs of the future.
Being a mentor at BUILD has been a very humbling and eye-opening experience. It is incredible to see the passion that goes into developing a concept into a product that the students are proud of. Working at Thrasio gives me the confidence to tell these students that there is a world that values their entrepreneurial spirits and needs their problem-solving skills.
Being able to give back to my own middle school was an incredible professional accomplishment that’s also very important to me personally. I’m thrilled to be able to impact the communities where I grew up and to potentially introduce new career possibilities for bright young minds.
We encourage Thrashers to utilize our unlimited paid time off policy and take action on issues that are most meaningful to them.
Take off with a group of positive people out to define the future.

Some say fortune favors the brave. Josh and Carlos’ good fortune started when they met while working on a purpose-driven jewelry brand called Bravelets, founded by current Thrasio COO Stephanie Fox. Though the company was initially successful, environmental factors and a lack of resources kept it from growing to its maximum potential. This gave them an idea: What if they could roll up struggling ecommerce companies into one portfolio and use a single set of operators and scalable processes to take them to the next level? Talk about entering a brave new world. Together, they disrupted the 3P marketplace on Amazon and established a category that has gone on to inspire hundreds of competitors.

Wer wagt, gewinnt. Josh Silberstein und Carlos Cashman verkörpern dieses Motto. Die beiden Thrasio Gründer trafen sich bei der Arbeit an einer Kampagne für die Schmuckmarke Bravelets von Stephanie Fox, die heute COO bei Thrasio ist. Trotz anfänglichen Erfolgen konnte die Marke aufgrund von externen Faktoren und mangelnden Ressourcen jedoch nie ihr volles Potenzial entfalten. Das brachte das Team auf eine Idee: Könnte man angeschlagene E-Commerce-Shops aufkaufen und diese mit Hilfe von skalierbaren Prozessen in die nächste Liga befördern? Gemeinsam wagten sie sich auf ein völlig neues Terrain vor. Dabei haben sie nicht nur den Amazon-Markt für Dritt-Anbieter aufgemischt, sondern eine komplett neue Branche geschaffen, deren Erfolg hunderte von Wettbewerbern hervorgebracht hat.

Three of our brand owners share hot takes and takeaways after logging huge sales during Amazon’s fall event.
from Amazon’s Prime Early Access Sale (“PEAS”) is revealing that the products with big sales didn’t come with big price tags. For Thrasio, this meant the event and many of our brands went together like PEAS and carrots, with several of those brands having their best days yet.
In our new Q&A series “Best in Thras,” we teased out some reflections on PEAS with three questions for three Thrashers whose brands cooked the competition.
. It snatched a top spot in Lightning Deals and reached #2 best-seller status in pet supplies.
136,440 hours of colorful dancing flames keeping customers warm this winter.
™ glow-in-the-dark basketballs, footballs, and soccer balls. All three products simultaneously held the #1 best-seller spot during the sale, and the brand absolutely crushed it with sales 1,000% bigger than July’s Prime Day, for its biggest Prime Day yet.
Why was your brand successful during this event?
Choosing an attractive price point for our customers helps a lot.
In addition, we were able to obtain a lot of affiliate assistance for external traffic while leveraging coupons.
: We ran three Lightning Deals on the top Magical Flames listings, stacking them with coupons and exclusive discounts for affiliate/influencer partners, to create attractive final price points for our customers across all pack sizes. Additionally, leading into PEAS, we launched 600+ new Amazon PPC campaigns, which drove rank and sessions on key upper funnel keywords.
: We leaned into the available Amazon promotions, ran analysis of deals on those promotional prices, and had great discounts at a great time of year. Soccer, football and basketball seasons are all starting, it’s getting darker outside earlier and GlowCity is a great gift for the holidays.
How will you extend and/or learn from that success to have a strong Turkey 5?
: We will continue to push for brand recognition off of Amazon by working with affiliates, running Facebook ads, and leveraging TikTok – as well as YouTube soon.
for conversions and brand recognition while running a Top Deal. We are also making sure we are positioned with enough inventory to sell through November, December, and deals.
: Given the historical “stocking stuffer” appeal for Magical Flames, we will lean heavily into this theme heading into T5 via strategic copy updates, paid traffic campaigns, and affiliate/influencer coverage. Improving brand exposure for Magical Flames on these search terms will enable our Turkey 5 Lightning Deals to reach a larger set of customers. Furthermore, we will look beyond Turkey 5 to continue offering attractive deals up until the Christmas delivery cutoff.
: Inventory is not unlimited, so we’ll set specific deal unit limits to maintain healthy inventory throughout Q4.
On T5, a deal can really take off, which is great. But you want to make sure you leave inventory to capture higher margin sales from the “halo” effect of deals. On GlowCity, our sales were up nearly 100 percent the week following PEAS compared to the week before.
What piece of advice would you give to sellers coming out of PEAS?
: Leverage coupons and price your product to sell during high traffic events. Then ride the algorithm spike wave at a higher price point.
: Do not undersell the power of deal and coupon stacking when trying to improve your deals page placement. Stacked coupons may not be visible on the deals page, but they positively impact conversion, which bodes well with Amazon’s ranking algorithm.
: Nothing too extraordinary here; run some final optimization tests over the next few weeks (creative, copy, etc.), work to have strong keyword rank the week leading into T5, and utilize the promotions Amazon offers. Choose the promotions that match the goals for your products – promotions have varying discounts and expected lifts.

https://www.thrasio.com/resources/blog/external-traffic-amazon-attribution
------------------------
External traffic is critical to boosting sales and revenue from your Amazon listings. Measuring its performance is simple with this solution.
Rising PPC costs. Shifting consumer behavior. Increased competition. Just when you think you’ve got a handle on the best marketing strategy to drive sales to your Amazon FBA business, a new challenge pops up like some twisted game of Whac-A-Mole. That’s why it’s never been more important to have a comprehensive strategy that meets consumers wherever they are and is capable of handling new tests and surprises.
or preparing to sell, this tool will make your marketing efforts more fruitful and possibly increase the valuation of your company.
What is Amazon Attribution?
. Amazon Attribution is a solution created by Amazon to serve a similar need: the measurement of marketing channel performance on your site; in this case, that refers to non-Amazon marketing channel performance on your Amazon listing.
As you might know, advertisers are unable to place tracking pixels on their Amazon listings – so this tool is key to tracking your marketing performance. While still in beta, Amazon Attribution has been around for some time. It allows you to append URL parameters to your ads and pass information like campaign, ad group, channel, and publisher to the attribution console. This allows you to measure detailed product views (DPVs), add to carts (ATCs), units sold, total revenue, and more from your external traffic campaigns.
In addition to informing better ad spend decisions, Amazon Attribution ensures you have line of sight into conversions, which are paramount to ranking well in organic Amazon searches. Driving too much non-converting traffic to your listing risks hurting your Amazon SEO performance. In addition, advertisers receive a referral bonus from Amazon for every sale they generate via Amazon Attribution (more on this later).
.
From here you have two options: create the campaign manually or upload a file to create in bulk.
We recommend leveraging the bulk file creation flow if you’re starting with a paid search campaign. If you’re testing a paid social campaign you can use the manual creation flow.
Once you have the template you’ll want to create your campaign in the Google Ads editor and post it to Google/Bing as paused. From there you’ll need to download your keywords from Google and input the data into the bulk upload template columns below. Next, add the products you’d like to track in the products section.
Once the final URL suffix is added you’re ready to launch your campaign! There are also third-party tools that automate this process, but the manual flow is a great place to start if you’re using attribution for the first time.
As with any marketing tool, Amazon Attribution does have limitations. It’s important to note that once a campaign is launched it takes two full days for sales data to backfill completely. Because of this, we recommend ramping up campaigns gradually so you can optimize based on conversion data before really scaling up.
Amazon Attribution also uses a last-click attribution model with a 14-day look-back window. This model gives full credit for a sale or conversion to the touchpoint a customer last clicked on or engaged with before making a purchase. This is critical to keep in mind when analyzing campaign performance, because single-touch attribution models only tell part of the story.
Finally, to maintain user privacy Amazon masks conversion data for keywords that have not met the required daily click threshold. The banner below will indicate if you’re experiencing conversion masking in your campaigns.
This click threshold is cumulative, which means that viewing conversion data at the campaign level will provide the most accurate conversion amount for your campaigns. The click threshold is small but must be met for conversion data to appear. Conversions will not show at the ad group level if the particular ad group has not met that daily click threshold.
. On average, brands can earn a 10 percent bonus from qualifying sales simply by signing up. To calculate how much you may receive, multiply your qualifying sales from the relevant product category by the corresponding minimum bonus rate in the table below. Amazon now includes this amount in the reporting section of Attribution.
There is a two-month waiting period to receive the credit to your account, which accommodates order cancellations and customer returns. This bonus can really add up over time: one of our products, for example, generated $60k in referral bonus money over a seven-month period. The cherry on top? The bonus money also helps make leveraging external traffic easier for low-margin products.
Amazon Attribution is an easy tool to learn and a powerful way to keep growing your FBA business. The time you put into using it will easily pay off in the long run. Whether you’re currently running external campaigns or are planning to in the future, make sure to use it to track your sales.

------------------------
Reeling in ecommerce sales takes skill. But to tackle new markets, you need new tools in your box. Our sales chief helps you cast a wider net.
Your megahit coffee frother nabbed the Amazon Best Seller Badge moooonths ago. In fact, your whole line of coffee products are buzzworthy category leaders. Revenue is up and so are your margins. Impressive? You bet. But your growth doesn’t have to stop there.
For businesses at the peak of their Amazon game, the next step is brewing up a strong omnichannel strategy.
What is omnichannel?
People often use the term “omnichannel” when they’re simply selling products through multiple marketplaces and channels – Amazon, direct to consumer (DTC), retail, and maybe social commerce. But the endgame for a true omnichannel strategy is complete integration, so that your markets, sales data, the customer experience, and the brand are all part of one intelligent ecosystem. Each piece plays a role in lifting the business and delivers a personalized experience to the customer.
notes that over 85% of shopping is still happening in physical stores.
Is your brand retail ready?
Your product has to be unique.
at a great price.
You need a gross profit margin of at least 50%.
Wholesaling can yield excellent gross margins – and more control over those margins. You set your price, and (in general) it sticks, which makes it different from selling through Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), says Esposito. “It’s not a daily battle to fix your price against your competitors’ pricing, which can lead you to a dangerous race to the bottom.” You’re also not paying FBA fees or pouring money into pay-per-click ads to get eyes on your product page. But you will be fulfilling your own wholesale orders and complying with unique terms associated with major retail. You’ll incur more operating costs due to shipping errors, product returns, payment terms, and many unique service requirements by retailer. So you’ve got to be able to maintain healthy profit margins before considering a run at retail.
Assume you’re going to sell your product to retailers at a wholesale price that is a 50% discount from your full FBA retail. Depending on the category of the product, that’s a good rule of thumb (also known as keystone pricing).
Do your research.
For certain categories, like cleaning supplies, there are more than a dozen national retailers that could sell your product. In other categories, like toys, you may only be able to place your product with three or four retailers – saturating your opportunities fairly quickly.
To test the waters, think about what kind of store you want your product to be in and why. What else is on the shelves in that store? What makes your product different from those other brands? What customers are you trying to reach? And why is your product going to make a difference in their lives?
The answers to these questions are going to guide your retail strategy – what stores you’re going after and how you’re going to craft your pitch to their buyers (but more on that later).
What are the drawbacks?
Supply chain is different for retail. You need to partner with a third-party logistics (3PL) company that can fulfill retail and have a systems infrastructure that connects you seamlessly to your 3PL and customer. You’ll be challenged to meet different compliance regulations or standards for both your products and packaging – and again, these challenges can and will differ by retailer. This may require legal advice or design expertise. Traditional retail triggers a fundamentally different operating structure than an FBA brand.
Managing supply chain and inventory is one of the biggest challenges of moving from FBA to an in-store environment. In retail in particular, stocking out is just not an option. Empty shelves are a retailer’s money-losing nightmare. If you miss orders, you could be hit with hefty chargebacks that could sink your brand, not to mention your reputation among buyers. If you become a headache for a buyer, you’ll lose their business for good.
In retail, people really do shop with their eyes first, which also means you need a great packaging designer who gets the voice of your brand and can make your product stand out on store shelves. The retail shopper is confronted by a sea of products and packaging, and you have a split second to attract their attention and highlight the uniqueness of your product!
So how do you get your products in front of buyers?
According to Esposito, there are a few ways you can get your foot in the door with retailers.
First, attend trade shows for your category. Say you’re in the pet category. Just start Googling “top pet retail trade shows,” find one that looks like it suits your product best, and sign up. You’ll meet a lot of mom and pop buyers, but you’ll also build your network and learn from other attendees. Esposito also recommends setting up an account on faire.com, which is like an Amazon for wholesalers.
Another approach would be to contact a manufacturer’s representative. Again, a Google search will bring up a number of experienced representatives who know the industry and have established relationships with the buyers you’re trying to get your product in front of. They tend to work on a 5% commission for major accounts, but the cost might be well worth the guidance they provide. You can also meet these reps at trade shows or through referrals.
Lastly, try good old-fashioned cold calling. If you have a successful “digitally native” brand and can tout a category leadership position with great reviews, most retail merchants will give you a look. Bombard them with samples and category knowledge and they may be your next best friend!
When an omnichannel strategy is firing on all cylinders, all the channels synergistically play a role in lifting overall sales and building brand equity. “We call it the flywheel effect,” says Esposito.
. The pet odor eliminator spray is on the shelves of many Target and PetSmart stores. Someone shopping for dog food in Target may see a bottle of Angry Orange pet odor eliminator and not initially buy it. But later, when they’re searching for pet odor eliminator products on their phone and Angry Orange appears with an average customer review rating of 4.4 out of 5 stars, the customer knows it’s a trusted brand. After they pull the trigger on a purchase, we can then retarget that customer for additional purchases of Angry Orange products through ads on Amazon and Google.
We first brought Angry Orange to a few hardware stores. Products flew off the shelves, and we were able to share that success as proof positive that Angry Orange could make money for other national retailers.
If you’re a top seller in your category, chances are you’ve got a great product. And getting that product into as many hands as possible means meeting customers where they are – on their computers, their phones, and yes – in brick-and-mortar stores too.

By selling quality hammocks at an affordable price, Wise Owl founder Sarah Douglass hopes to help people make more lasting memories in nature.
, Sarah Douglass, remembers the day that she and her husband, Todd, walked out of a national outdoors retailer with all the equipment they needed for a backpacking trip – and an eye-popping receipt for $2,500.
That bothered her. A lot.
To Sarah, nature was a place for restoration and rejuvenation. She felt that everyone should be able to experience that – and the price of admission to the Great Outdoors, by her calculation, should be as close as possible to free.
Plenty of people have thoughts like these. But most people don’t have the ability, tenacity, or audacity to act on those ideas, much less see them through to completion.
in both the camping and patio categories, along with camping pillows, bug nets, and a whole bevy of hammock accessories.
ven a GED. According to standard career advice, those are minimum requirements for professional success. Sarah Douglass didn’t get that memo.
Her family went to Hawaii once — the only “real” vacation they ever took. Other than that, it was twice-yearly trips to the Strawberry Music Festival in Camp Mather near Yosemite. Families pitched tents or strung hammocks between the pines. There was folk and bluegrass music and jam sessions going all day and night. Kids roamed the woods and spent hours swimming and crafting. The whole experience ended with a Sunday revival at Birch Lake. For her, the festival was the pinnacle of childhood happiness; for her family, it also happened to be a vacation that was pretty close to free.
Around 18, Sarah briefly decided to try her hand at school again. She became pregnant. And that was that. She started a new chapter as a single parent, working 2 or 3 jobs at a time to raise her son. Of course, it was hard.
Sarah spent plenty of years working for other people. A pattern emerged. She’d learn the business until she could pretty much run the business, then she’d ask for a big raise, and walk if she didn’t get one. She walked a few times. She was good at working, liked working – it was the working “for other people” part that needed changing. Along the way, Sarah met her now-husband, Todd, who shared a similar set of values, including a desire to strike out and build a business they could call their own.
But hammocks were a no-fuss piece of equipment that represented happiness to Sarah. Within a few minutes, people could be set up, relaxing, and listening to the gurgle of a stream, ocean waves, or a breeze in the trees. Hammocks were a way to get people enjoying nature fast, easy, and on the cheap.
Hammocks, as a product, also had some clear business advantages: they were relatively simple to manufacture and their compact size made them economical to ship. The fabric color and style options were endless, so they could always be on trend as customer tastes changed. Plus, Wise Owl could produce a lot of hammock accessories to eventually expand its product line.
From the stitching thread counts to the way the seams felt on bare skin (after all, customers might be using a hammock while wearing shorts or a swimsuit), Sarah and Todd left no detail unexamined.
Of the low-cost models, none passed the Sarah test. Too scratchy, too small, poorly made, too difficult to set up. She found one she did love – but it came with a nearly $100 price tag.
They had a mission for their new Amazon ecommerce business: Make the greatest hammock anyone ever owned at half the price.
When she was dreaming up the Wise Owl brand, Sarah created a script for a video ad. In her storyboards, she would proffer a Wise Owl hammock toward the camera and explain to viewers that what she was holding in her hand was not in fact a hammock at all… but happiness. Wise Owl was selling the feeling she had in childhood, what she wanted everyone to experience themselves.
In 2015, Sarah and Todd drew down their savings to place her first purchase order of 200 hammocks. The day the products arrived on her doorstep was another lesson in the challenges of building an Amazon ecommerce business. She opened the box and … the Wise Owl logo was the wrong color. Even worse, the hammocks were stuffed into long and skinny carrying sacks. “They were basically two-foot-long sausages,” she says. She pulled them all apart and paid a local seamstress to fix every logo patch and every sack.
Today, Wise Owl is a booming online Amazon ecommerce business. The hammocks are nearing 40,000 ratings and maintain an impressive average of 4.8. Wise Owl has earned dual Best Seller Badges in both the camping hammocks and patio hammocks categories, while its camping pillows and hammock bug net also have Best Seller Badges. In 2021 alone, the brand sold hundreds of thousands of units in its product line. At the end of 2021, the Camping Hammock was capturing the majority of the market share for camping hammocks on Amazon.
hammocks will launch in the Canadian, UK, and German Amazon markets – a huge expansion for what started as a small Amazon ecommerce business.

------------------------
Every company has growing pains. To maintain a healthy outlook for your brand's future, don't overlook these key action items.
To strengthen the health of your FBA brand, it can pay to look beyond the bottom line. Have you grown a solid base of happy repeat customers? Or earned an avalanche of 5-star Amazon reviews for your products?  These are the kind of success markers that don’t directly appear on a profit and loss statement — but they can translate into higher customer lifetime value and a stronger FBA brand. In other words, to build an FBA brand with staying power, it helps to consider the big picture of your business.
Here are 4 strategies to think about.
If you’re used to thinking only about profit margin, you may want to start thinking about profit-dollars as well. Your goal should be to improve conversion rates and sales velocity on the products that provide the most bang for the buck in profit-dollars.
Conversion share is the number of times customers bought your product after searching with a given keyword, divided by the total number of times customers bought any product after searching with that same keyword. You want this number to grow over time. It shows you’re capturing a bigger slice of the pie linked to keywords associated with your product.
. The report is a gold mine of insights about your category and your FBA business.
to see which images perform best.
And yes, go for the video. A lot of people don’t incorporate video because it seems too hard or complex. Think of this: we’ve made very professional marketing videos with celebrities that have cost tens of thousands of dollars – and in some scenarios, those convert less than something made in 20 minutes on an iPhone. The lesson? It doesn’t have to be an insane production to be successful. It just needs to connect with customers.
Reviews are the lifeblood of an Amazon ecommerce business. You know this. When faced with an array of similar products, customers often default to the one with the most positive reviews. High-quality reviews start with a high-quality product, of course, but after that, you’ll need to do a little more work to earn your stars.
The work is well worth it. You want to create a moat of positive reviews around your products – an unbridgeable gap between your well-loved products and those of your closest competitors. And to increase your volume of positive reviews, you’ll need to increase your volume of sales. This may mean selling at a loss via a temporary price cut, running Amazon Deals, or increasing ad spending to boost traffic.

Lifelong Online’s co-founders built a powerhouse brand that put a dent in India’s appliance market. The secret to their success? Listen to who matters most – the customer.
market for ecommerce businesses. To be successful, brands must navigate the complexities of India’s delivery infrastructure. They also need to understand the diverse needs of Indian customers, what they want, how they shop, and what they value. In a country of 1.4 billion people, that is extraordinarily difficult.
Which is why the team charged with leading Thrasio’s foray into India are people who know what it takes to build a successful ecommerce brand there.
“It’s our customers, their stories, and their experiences with our products that really inspire me,” says Bharat Kalia, one the three co-founders and CEO of Lifelong Online (now called Lifelong, a Thrasio Company).
Kalia founded Lifelong in 2015 with two partners – Atul Raheja and Varun Grover. Since then, they’ve created more than 100 products, primarily in the kitchen-and-home, and health-and-fitness categories. Air fryers, stoves, stand mixers, treadmills, massagers, hair straighteners: a Lifelong product can be found in about a million homes in more than 500 cities.
The three founders of India-based company Lifelong, a Thrasio company.
But perhaps its biggest triumph is how Lifelong boldly entered the appliance market – a notoriously difficult category dominated by large, entrenched brands. “The products I was using in my home were the same my parents used,” Kalia says.
can be tucked behind a couch or under a bed – the ultimate solution for health-conscious Indians living in space-challenged homes. Today it is one of the best-selling products in the Lifelong line.
Or consider the case of Lifelong’s early version bicycle. Customers were frustrated with how much time and effort it took to put together. “People were saying ‘This is the hardest thing I ever did,’” Kalia says. The next version had just 5 moving parts and came 90% pre-assembled. Now they’re on version 3.
The customer is both king and queen at Lifelong.
A new product launch can involve 2 or 3 interactions with customers in a month, conversations that are coded and analyzed to ensure products are delivering happiness and satisfaction. “We analyze a ton of data and carefully codify our questions before making customer calls,” Kalia says.
This extraordinary openness to feedback goes back to Lifelong’s very first product, an oven toaster griller. In their enthusiasm, Kalia and the founders mounted a product listing before the product was actually ready. “We were super happy to get our first order,” Kalia says. “The problem was we only had a prototype.” He gave the customer a heads-up that the product was a bit of a work in progress – and then packed it up and mailed it across the country to the customer.
in less than prime condition. (“Basically, it was mangled,” Kalia says.) After multiple calls with the customer, Kalia delivered a new model to the customer within 2 weeks. After all that, the customer left Lifelong a positive review.
Lifelong’s employees hard at work building a next generation consumer goods company in India. Thrasio bought a majority share in Lifelong in January.
Lifelong’s goal of reaching every household in a country of 1.4 billion people will require keeping a careful eye on how the market is changing. People aren’t as tied to legacy brands as they once were, Kalia says, and younger generations are more comfortable with ecommerce.

, your gateway to building a better consumer goods company. Every edition, we’ll share stories, insights, and expertise on a topic critical to the industry. This issue: the importance of quality assurance and making sure the products you deliver truly deliver.
Your customers expect the best. Here are 5 steps to build a strong quality assurance program and become more effective at preventing the defective.
Everyone’s been there. You buy a product that you’re excited to use, and then, when you need it, it fails to live up to its claims. Total headache. But for a business owner, one defective item can potentially set off a torrent of torment: a batch that has to be recalled, poor reviews that affect customer acquisition and loyalty, and even additional rounds of production. Fortunately, a strong quality assurance program can save the day, catching defective products before they ever ship to your customers.
If you don’t have a program in place, fear not: Axel Gonzalez has your back. Thrasio’s senior director of quality assurance and sustainability shares 5 steps to get you started.
Take, for example, the premium 10-piece bartender set Thrasio sells through our Mixology & Craft brand. It’s a showpiece with a premium price point. As such, its form can’t have scratches, dirty marks, or any flaws in its shape. Its strainer has to snugly fit inside the shaker so that no liquid leaks, while each piece must also fit in the display stand. And in order to meet Mixology & Craft’s goal of creating delicious cocktails, the shakers need to function as closed vessels that allow you to quickly mix ingredients together while simultaneously chilling the drink. This bartender set needs to bring your dreams of perfect libations to life.
Take some time to think about how form, fit, and function apply to your products. Literally make a list. This is the start of your quality assurance program, how you’ll begin to understand which attributes need to be assessed and tested. Depending on the complexity of your product, it could be a long list. But by clearly identifying what really matters to your products early on, you’ll set yourself up for a smooth operation and strong defense against trouble down the road.
Once you’ve decided what you’re going to test for, you need a resource to guide you through the process. Enter the quality acceptance document.
“The quality acceptance document is essentially the playbook that you will use to carry out your product inspections,” Gonzalez notes.
Picture a playbook for an NFL team. At its most basic, you’ll have your coaching staff and players (or, who’s leading and conducting the testing process), your schedule (how often you test), and your gameplan (how you’ll conduct tests). Instead of using Xs and Os and other visual aids to run your plays, however, you’ll use pictures that help you tell which products will pass a quality check, which will fail, and why. The playbook will also outline the sample sizes you’ll test and define what percentage of defective products will signal the need to reject a whole batch.
Use your written explanation of ideal form, fit, and function to identify what imperfections to test for. These will fall into 1 of 3 categories: minor defect, major defect, or critical defect. For example, a scratch on a cocktail shaker might be considered a minor defect, while a warped shaker that doesn’t fit inside the other shaker could be deemed a critical defect. The amount of defects you find in your sample size will give you an idea about whether you can ship your products, need to do additional testing, or have to – sigh – reject the batch outright.
You can then come up with your own sample sizes and rejection thresholds, but the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) also has a standardized acceptance quality limit (AQL) sampling system for inspection by attributes. The AQL chart can be used to provide information and guidance on inspection levels, rejection thresholds, and sample sizes for individual shipments.
If this seems like a lot, it doesn’t have to be. You don’t want to go it alone when creating a quality acceptance document. Incorporate your supplier into the process.
“It only makes sense that your supplier agrees to everything in the document so that both parties are on the same page in terms of what is and is not acceptable,” Gonzalez says.
By having quality standards clearly laid out and agreed upon ahead of time, you reduce the risk of having a drawn-out dispute with your supplier over an unsatisfactory batch of product.
Striking the right balance on quality assurance can also be tricky. You have to take a bit of a Goldilocks approach with it. Too strict and you run the risk of rejecting too much product, which can lead to delays and stockouts. Too lax and defective products can end up making their way to customers, paving the way for negative reviews. Knowing early on what is realistic for your supplier to achieve from a quality standpoint can save you a lot of time and money down the road.
Oh … and if you’ve never built a quality acceptance document before, no problem.
Templates to help structure your document are available online.
Gonzalez strongly advises against relying on your manufacturer to carry out product inspections on your behalf. “You want an impartial inspector,” he says. “You need to insist on it. Otherwise, you can be left with a supplier who cuts corners when it comes to quality assurance in the hopes of avoiding rejects.” But, Gonzalez adds, there are a few things to keep in mind when looking for a solid third-party inspection company to partner with.
Third-party inspection companies need to be available on short notice. Our partner promises to have an agent on site and ready to conduct an inspection, anywhere in continental Asia, within 24 hours. This kind of flexibility is invaluable, as it minimizes delays across our vast network of suppliers. But even if you only have a few suppliers, if the past 2 years have taught us anything, it’s that unexpected delays and last-minute changes are a fact of life. Knowing that your third-party inspection company has the flexibility to swiftly react to these changes is a huge value-add.
Find an inspection company with top-notch technology platforms that allow you to quickly and easily access all of your inspection reports across your suppliers in real time. That’s especially helpful if you’ve got a lot of suppliers (and thus a lot of inspection reports).
Your third-party inspection company should be aligned with the material in your quality acceptance document. After all, they’ll be the ones carrying out the inspections. In their reports, data should be presented clearly and succinctly, allowing you to make quick, informed decisions on which products are ready to ship. A good inspection report will begin with a summary of the main findings, followed by detailed information to support those assessments. When vetting third-party inspection companies, it’s not a bad idea to ask them for sample reports to get a feel for how they present data.
Schedule inspections as soon as your products come off the line – the sooner the better. Why? That gives you time to course correct if there’s a problem. You don’t want to be caught with insufficient inventory because of extended retesting time frames or full-batch rejections.
There’s no “one size fits all” approach to quality assurance. Every product is unique. Even 2 sellers who sell a similar product may have different ideas about what quality testing should look like. And that’s OK. You’re taking steps that give your products the best chance to arrive on the doorsteps of your customers – exactly how they expect them to be.

Während Thrasio expandiert, arbeiten wir hart daran, dass unser globales Bewusstsein noch schneller wächst. Unser Einfluss auf die Umwelt und die Gemeinden hilft uns bei der Entscheidungsfindung.
Im Rahmen unseres Programms für verantwortungsbewusste Beschaffung arbeiten wir mit dem weltweit führenden Wirtschaftsverband für offenen und nachhaltigen Handel amfori zusammen, um Instrumente und bewährte Verfahren zur Bewertung der sozialen Leistung unserer Lieferkette einzuführen. Die Lieferanten verpflichten sich, den amfori-Verhaltenskodex zu folgen, der 11 Grundsätze umfasst: von fairer Bezahlung bis zum Umweltschutz.
Im Rahmen unserer Initiative zur Nachhaltigkeit in der Lieferkette haben wir den Standard des Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol übernommen, um unsere Treibhausgasemissionen zu messen, zu verwalten und zu melden. Darüber hinaus haben wir uns mit Pathzero zusammengetan, um die GHG-Emissionen von Port-to-Port-Frachtgeschäften anhand der im Protokoll festgelegten Best Practices einzuschätzen.
Um die Gemeinschaften, in denen wir leben und arbeiten, zu stärken, haben wir bedeutsame, unterhaltsame und wirkungsvolle Mentoring- und philanthropische Möglichkeiten geschaffen.
Das Stipendium von Thrasio in Zusammenarbeit mit der Success Academy (SA) in Harlem bietet High-School-Schülern die Möglichkeit, von unseren Mitarbeitern zu lernen, wie man ein soziales Unternehmen von Grund auf recherchiert, aufbaut und erweitert. Stipendiaten arbeiten in Teams und werden nach mehreren Workshops mit Seed-Finanzierung belohnt, um in ihren Communitys mindestens ein akzeptables Produkt oder eine tragbare Dienstleistung zu starten. So wie Amazon es für kleine und mittlere Unternehmen (KMU) getan hat, hoffen wir auch, das Unternehmertum weiter zu demokratisieren, indem wir Studenten frühzeitig dazu inspirieren, ihr Potenzial als Unternehmer der Zukunft zu erkunden.
Mentorin bei BUILD zu sein, war eine sehr beeindruckende und aufschlussreiche Erfahrung. Es ist unglaublich zu sehen, mit welcher Leidenschaft ein Konzept in ein Produkt umgesetzt wird, auf das die Schüler stolz sind. Die Arbeit bei Thrasio gibt mir das Selbstvertrauen, diesen Studenten zu sagen, dass es eine Welt gibt, die ihren Unternehmergeist schätzt und ihre Lösungsfähigkeiten braucht.
Die Möglichkeit, meiner eigenen Mittelschule etwas zurückzugeben, war eine unglaubliche berufliche Leistung, die auch für mich persönlich sehr wichtig ist. Ich bin begeistert, dass ich in den Gemeinden, in denen ich aufgewachsen bin, etwas bewirken kann, und dass ich klugen jungen Köpfen neue Karrieremöglichkeiten eröffnen kann.
Wir ermutigen die Thrasher, unsere Politik der unbegrenzten bezahlten Freistellung zu nutzen und sich für die Themen einzusetzen, die ihnen am wichtigsten sind.
Machen Sie sich mit einer Gruppe positiver Menschen auf, die Zukunft zu gestalten.

As Thrasio expands across the world, we are committed to growing our global consciousness even faster. Our impact on the environment and the opportunity to lift people up help guide every decision we make.
Through our Responsible Sourcing Program, we partner with amfori, the leading global business association for open and sustainable trade, to implement tools and best practices that evaluate the social performance of our supply chain. Suppliers are committed to follow the amfori code of conduct – 11 principles ranging from fair payments to environmental protection.
As part of our Supply Chain Sustainability initiative, we’ve adopted the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol standard to measure, manage, and report our GHG emissions. We've also partnered with Pathzero to estimate GHG emissions from port-to-port freight operations, following best practices as specified in the Protocol.
To strengthen the communities in which we live and work, we’ve created meaningful, fun, and high-engagement mentorship and philanthropic opportunities.
Thrasio’s fellowship in collaboration with Success Academy (SA) in Harlem offers high school students the opportunity to learn from our employees how to research, build, and scale a social enterprise from scratch. Fellows work in teams and, after a series of workshops, are awarded seed funding to launch a minimum viable product or service in their communities. As Amazon has done for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), we also hope to further democratize entrepreneurship by inspiring students early on to explore their potential as the entrepreneurs of the future.
Being a mentor at BUILD has been a very humbling and eye-opening experience. It is incredible to see the passion that goes into developing a concept into a product that the students are proud of. Working at Thrasio gives me the confidence to tell these students that there is a world that values their entrepreneurial spirits and needs their problem-solving skills.
Being able to give back to my own middle school was an incredible professional accomplishment that’s also very important to me personally. I’m thrilled to be able to impact the communities where I grew up and to potentially introduce new career possibilities for bright young minds.
We encourage Thrashers to utilize our unlimited paid time off policy and take action on issues that are most meaningful to them.
Take off with a group of positive people out to define the future.

Our leadership team is made up of Amazon veterans, e-commerce connoisseurs and successful entrepreneurs who are at the forefront of rethinking the way products are brought to the world.
Wer wagt, gewinnt. Josh Silberstein und Carlos Cashman verkörpern dieses Motto. Die beiden Thrasio Gründer trafen sich bei der Arbeit an einer Kampagne für die Schmuckmarke Bravelets von Stephanie Fox, die heute COO bei Thrasio ist. Trotz anfänglichen Erfolgen konnte die Marke aufgrund von externen Faktoren und mangelnden Ressourcen jedoch nie ihr volles Potenzial entfalten. Das brachte das Team auf eine Idee: Könnte man angeschlagene E-Commerce-Shops aufkaufen und diese mit Hilfe von skalierbaren Prozessen in die nächste Liga befördern? Gemeinsam wagten sie sich auf ein völlig neues Terrain vor. Dabei haben sie nicht nur den Amazon-Markt für Dritt-Anbieter aufgemischt, sondern eine komplett neue Branche geschaffen, deren Erfolg hunderte von Wettbewerbern hervorgebracht hat.

At Thrasio, we’re reimagining how to make the world’s most-loved products accessible to everyone. So we work with successful sellers, using a deep understanding of rankings, ratings, and reviews – plus supply chain and marketing smarts – to transform the art and science of commerce.
We now feel like stronger business owners because we have a solid model for structuring any future brands we build—and can count on Thrasio to have our backs at any time.
I love how quickly Thrasio can move, how fair they are with their valuation, and how well they aligned with our vision. I returned to Thrasio to sell my second and third businesses.
Thrasio was able to consistently keep revenue strong through 2020 despite the numerous manufacturing, logistic, fulfillment constraints so many sellers faced during COVID. I don’t doubt they handled the account better than I could have myself given the same challenges.

At Thrasio, we’re reimagining how to make the world’s most-loved products accessible to everyone. So we work with successful sellers, using a deep understanding of rankings, ratings, and reviews – plus supply chain and marketing smarts – to transform the art and science of commerce.
We now feel like stronger business owners because we have a solid model for structuring any future brands we build—and can count on Thrasio to have our backs at any time.
I love how quickly Thrasio can move, how fair they are with their valuation, and how well they aligned with our vision. I returned to Thrasio to sell my second and third businesses.
Thrasio was able to consistently keep revenue strong through 2020 despite the numerous manufacturing, logistic, fulfillment constraints so many sellers faced during COVID. I don’t doubt they handled the account better than I could have myself given the same challenges.

Some say fortune favors the brave. Josh and Carlos’ good fortune started when they met while working on a purpose-driven jewelry brand called Bravelets, founded by current Thrasio COO Stephanie Fox. Though the company was initially successful, environmental factors and a lack of resources kept it from growing to its maximum potential. This gave them an idea: What if they could roll up struggling ecommerce companies into one portfolio and use a single set of operators and scalable processes to take them to the next level? Talk about entering a brave new world. Together, they disrupted the 3P marketplace on Amazon and established a category that has gone on to inspire hundreds of competitors.

Three of our brand owners share hot takes and takeaways after logging huge sales during Amazon’s fall event.
from Amazon’s Prime Early Access Sale (“PEAS”) is revealing that the products with big sales didn’t come with big price tags. For Thrasio, this meant the event and many of our brands went together like PEAS and carrots, with several of those brands having their best days yet.
In our new Q&A series “Best in Thras,” we teased out some reflections on PEAS with three questions for three Thrashers whose brands cooked the competition.
. It snatched a top spot in Lightning Deals and reached #2 best-seller status in pet supplies.
136,440 hours of colorful dancing flames keeping customers warm this winter.
™ glow-in-the-dark basketballs, footballs, and soccer balls. All three products simultaneously held the #1 best-seller spot during the sale, and the brand absolutely crushed it with sales 1,000% bigger than July’s Prime Day, for its biggest Prime Day yet.
Why was your brand successful during this event?
Choosing an attractive price point for our customers helps a lot.
In addition, we were able to obtain a lot of affiliate assistance for external traffic while leveraging coupons.
: We ran three Lightning Deals on the top Magical Flames listings, stacking them with coupons and exclusive discounts for affiliate/influencer partners, to create attractive final price points for our customers across all pack sizes. Additionally, leading into PEAS, we launched 600+ new Amazon PPC campaigns, which drove rank and sessions on key upper funnel keywords.
: We leaned into the available Amazon promotions, ran analysis of deals on those promotional prices, and had great discounts at a great time of year. Soccer, football and basketball seasons are all starting, it’s getting darker outside earlier and GlowCity is a great gift for the holidays.
How will you extend and/or learn from that success to have a strong Turkey 5?
: We will continue to push for brand recognition off of Amazon by working with affiliates, running Facebook ads, and leveraging TikTok – as well as YouTube soon.
for conversions and brand recognition while running a Top Deal. We are also making sure we are positioned with enough inventory to sell through November, December, and deals.
: Given the historical “stocking stuffer” appeal for Magical Flames, we will lean heavily into this theme heading into T5 via strategic copy updates, paid traffic campaigns, and affiliate/influencer coverage. Improving brand exposure for Magical Flames on these search terms will enable our Turkey 5 Lightning Deals to reach a larger set of customers. Furthermore, we will look beyond Turkey 5 to continue offering attractive deals up until the Christmas delivery cutoff.
: Inventory is not unlimited, so we’ll set specific deal unit limits to maintain healthy inventory throughout Q4.
On T5, a deal can really take off, which is great. But you want to make sure you leave inventory to capture higher margin sales from the “halo” effect of deals. On GlowCity, our sales were up nearly 100 percent the week following PEAS compared to the week before.
What piece of advice would you give to sellers coming out of PEAS?
: Leverage coupons and price your product to sell during high traffic events. Then ride the algorithm spike wave at a higher price point.
: Do not undersell the power of deal and coupon stacking when trying to improve your deals page placement. Stacked coupons may not be visible on the deals page, but they positively impact conversion, which bodes well with Amazon’s ranking algorithm.
: Nothing too extraordinary here; run some final optimization tests over the next few weeks (creative, copy, etc.), work to have strong keyword rank the week leading into T5, and utilize the promotions Amazon offers.

------------------------
External traffic is critical to boosting sales and revenue from your Amazon listings. Measuring its performance is simple with this solution.
Rising PPC costs. Shifting consumer behavior. Increased competition. Just when you think you’ve got a handle on the best marketing strategy to drive sales to your Amazon FBA business, a new challenge pops up like some twisted game of Whac-A-Mole. That’s why it’s never been more important to have a comprehensive strategy that meets consumers wherever they are and is capable of handling new tests and surprises.
or preparing to sell, this tool will make your marketing efforts more fruitful and possibly increase the valuation of your company.
What is Amazon Attribution?
. Amazon Attribution is a solution created by Amazon to serve a similar need: the measurement of marketing channel performance on your site; in this case, that refers to non-Amazon marketing channel performance on your Amazon listing.
As you might know, advertisers are unable to place tracking pixels on their Amazon listings – so this tool is key to tracking your marketing performance. While still in beta, Amazon Attribution has been around for some time. It allows you to append URL parameters to your ads and pass information like campaign, ad group, channel, and publisher to the attribution console. This allows you to measure detailed product views (DPVs), add to carts (ATCs), units sold, total revenue, and more from your external traffic campaigns.
In addition to informing better ad spend decisions, Amazon Attribution ensures you have line of sight into conversions, which are paramount to ranking well in organic Amazon searches. Driving too much non-converting traffic to your listing risks hurting your Amazon SEO performance. In addition, advertisers receive a referral bonus from Amazon for every sale they generate via Amazon Attribution (more on this later).
.
From here you have two options: create the campaign manually or upload a file to create in bulk.
We recommend leveraging the bulk file creation flow if you’re starting with a paid search campaign. If you’re testing a paid social campaign you can use the manual creation flow.
Once you have the template you’ll want to create your campaign in the Google Ads editor and post it to Google/Bing as paused. From there you’ll need to download your keywords from Google and input the data into the bulk upload template columns below. Next, add the products you’d like to track in the products section.
Once the final URL suffix is added you’re ready to launch your campaign! There are also third-party tools that automate this process, but the manual flow is a great place to start if you’re using attribution for the first time.
As with any marketing tool, Amazon Attribution does have limitations. It’s important to note that once a campaign is launched it takes two full days for sales data to backfill completely. Because of this, we recommend ramping up campaigns gradually so you can optimize based on conversion data before really scaling up.
Amazon Attribution also uses a last-click attribution model with a 14-day look-back window. This model gives full credit for a sale or conversion to the touchpoint a customer last clicked on or engaged with before making a purchase. This is critical to keep in mind when analyzing campaign performance, because single-touch attribution models only tell part of the story.
Finally, to maintain user privacy Amazon masks conversion data for keywords that have not met the required daily click threshold. The banner below will indicate if you’re experiencing conversion masking in your campaigns.
This click threshold is cumulative, which means that viewing conversion data at the campaign level will provide the most accurate conversion amount for your campaigns. The click threshold is small but must be met for conversion data to appear. Conversions will not show at the ad group level if the particular ad group has not met that daily click threshold.
. On average, brands can earn a 10 percent bonus from qualifying sales simply by signing up. To calculate how much you may receive, multiply your qualifying sales from the relevant product category by the corresponding minimum bonus rate in the table below. Amazon now includes this amount in the reporting section of Attribution.
There is a two-month waiting period to receive the credit to your account, which accommodates order cancellations and customer returns. This bonus can really add up over time: one of our products, for example, generated $60k in referral bonus money over a seven-month period. The cherry on top? The bonus money also helps make leveraging external traffic easier for low-margin products.
Amazon Attribution is an easy tool to learn and a powerful way to keep growing your FBA business. The time you put into using it will easily pay off in the long run. Whether you’re currently running external campaigns or are planning to in the future, make sure to use it to track your sales.

https://www.thrasio.com/resources/blog/secrets-to-omnichannel-and-retail
------------------------
Reeling in ecommerce sales takes skill. But to tackle new markets, you need new tools in your box. Our sales chief helps you cast a wider net.
Your megahit coffee frother nabbed the Amazon Best Seller Badge moooonths ago. In fact, your whole line of coffee products are buzzworthy category leaders. Revenue is up and so are your margins. Impressive? You bet. But your growth doesn’t have to stop there.
For businesses at the peak of their Amazon game, the next step is brewing up a strong omnichannel strategy.
What is omnichannel?
People often use the term “omnichannel” when they’re simply selling products through multiple marketplaces and channels – Amazon, direct to consumer (DTC), retail, and maybe social commerce. But the endgame for a true omnichannel strategy is complete integration, so that your markets, sales data, the customer experience, and the brand are all part of one intelligent ecosystem. Each piece plays a role in lifting the business and delivers a personalized experience to the customer.
notes that over 85% of shopping is still happening in physical stores.
Is your brand retail ready?
Your product has to be unique.
at a great price.
You need a gross profit margin of at least 50%.
Wholesaling can yield excellent gross margins – and more control over those margins. You set your price, and (in general) it sticks, which makes it different from selling through Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), says Esposito. “It’s not a daily battle to fix your price against your competitors’ pricing, which can lead you to a dangerous race to the bottom.” You’re also not paying FBA fees or pouring money into pay-per-click ads to get eyes on your product page. But you will be fulfilling your own wholesale orders and complying with unique terms associated with major retail. You’ll incur more operating costs due to shipping errors, product returns, payment terms, and many unique service requirements by retailer. So you’ve got to be able to maintain healthy profit margins before considering a run at retail.
Assume you’re going to sell your product to retailers at a wholesale price that is a 50% discount from your full FBA retail. Depending on the category of the product, that’s a good rule of thumb (also known as keystone pricing).
Do your research.
For certain categories, like cleaning supplies, there are more than a dozen national retailers that could sell your product. In other categories, like toys, you may only be able to place your product with three or four retailers – saturating your opportunities fairly quickly.
To test the waters, think about what kind of store you want your product to be in and why. What else is on the shelves in that store? What makes your product different from those other brands? What customers are you trying to reach? And why is your product going to make a difference in their lives?
The answers to these questions are going to guide your retail strategy – what stores you’re going after and how you’re going to craft your pitch to their buyers (but more on that later).
What are the drawbacks?
Supply chain is different for retail. You need to partner with a third-party logistics (3PL) company that can fulfill retail and have a systems infrastructure that connects you seamlessly to your 3PL and customer. You’ll be challenged to meet different compliance regulations or standards for both your products and packaging – and again, these challenges can and will differ by retailer. This may require legal advice or design expertise. Traditional retail triggers a fundamentally different operating structure than an FBA brand.
Managing supply chain and inventory is one of the biggest challenges of moving from FBA to an in-store environment. In retail in particular, stocking out is just not an option. Empty shelves are a retailer’s money-losing nightmare. If you miss orders, you could be hit with hefty chargebacks that could sink your brand, not to mention your reputation among buyers. If you become a headache for a buyer, you’ll lose their business for good.
In retail, people really do shop with their eyes first, which also means you need a great packaging designer who gets the voice of your brand and can make your product stand out on store shelves. The retail shopper is confronted by a sea of products and packaging, and you have a split second to attract their attention and highlight the uniqueness of your product!
So how do you get your products in front of buyers?
According to Esposito, there are a few ways you can get your foot in the door with retailers.
First, attend trade shows for your category. Say you’re in the pet category. Just start Googling “top pet retail trade shows,” find one that looks like it suits your product best, and sign up. You’ll meet a lot of mom and pop buyers, but you’ll also build your network and learn from other attendees. Esposito also recommends setting up an account on faire.com, which is like an Amazon for wholesalers.
Another approach would be to contact a manufacturer’s representative. Again, a Google search will bring up a number of experienced representatives who know the industry and have established relationships with the buyers you’re trying to get your product in front of. They tend to work on a 5% commission for major accounts, but the cost might be well worth the guidance they provide. You can also meet these reps at trade shows or through referrals.
Lastly, try good old-fashioned cold calling. If you have a successful “digitally native” brand and can tout a category leadership position with great reviews, most retail merchants will give you a look. Bombard them with samples and category knowledge and they may be your next best friend!
When an omnichannel strategy is firing on all cylinders, all the channels synergistically play a role in lifting overall sales and building brand equity. “We call it the flywheel effect,” says Esposito.
. The pet odor eliminator spray is on the shelves of many Target and PetSmart stores. Someone shopping for dog food in Target may see a bottle of Angry Orange pet odor eliminator and not initially buy it. But later, when they’re searching for pet odor eliminator products on their phone and Angry Orange appears with an average customer review rating of 4.4 out of 5 stars, the customer knows it’s a trusted brand. After they pull the trigger on a purchase, we can then retarget that customer for additional purchases of Angry Orange products through ads on Amazon and Google.
We first brought Angry Orange to a few hardware stores. Products flew off the shelves, and we were able to share that success as proof positive that Angry Orange could make money for other national retailers.
If you’re a top seller in your category, chances are you’ve got a great product. And getting that product into as many hands as possible means meeting customers where they are – on their computers, their phones, and yes – in brick-and-mortar stores too.

By selling quality hammocks at an affordable price, Wise Owl founder Sarah Douglass hopes to help people make more lasting memories in nature.
, Sarah Douglass, remembers the day that she and her husband, Todd, walked out of a national outdoors retailer with all the equipment they needed for a backpacking trip – and an eye-popping receipt for $2,500.
That bothered her. A lot.
To Sarah, nature was a place for restoration and rejuvenation. She felt that everyone should be able to experience that – and the price of admission to the Great Outdoors, by her calculation, should be as close as possible to free.
Plenty of people have thoughts like these. But most people don’t have the ability, tenacity, or audacity to act on those ideas, much less see them through to completion.
in both the camping and patio categories, along with camping pillows, bug nets, and a whole bevy of hammock accessories.
ven a GED. According to standard career advice, those are minimum requirements for professional success. Sarah Douglass didn’t get that memo.
Her family went to Hawaii once — the only “real” vacation they ever took. Other than that, it was twice-yearly trips to the Strawberry Music Festival in Camp Mather near Yosemite. Families pitched tents or strung hammocks between the pines. There was folk and bluegrass music and jam sessions going all day and night. Kids roamed the woods and spent hours swimming and crafting. The whole experience ended with a Sunday revival at Birch Lake. For her, the festival was the pinnacle of childhood happiness; for her family, it also happened to be a vacation that was pretty close to free.
Around 18, Sarah briefly decided to try her hand at school again. She became pregnant. And that was that. She started a new chapter as a single parent, working 2 or 3 jobs at a time to raise her son. Of course, it was hard.
Sarah spent plenty of years working for other people. A pattern emerged. She’d learn the business until she could pretty much run the business, then she’d ask for a big raise, and walk if she didn’t get one. She walked a few times. She was good at working, liked working – it was the working “for other people” part that needed changing. Along the way, Sarah met her now-husband, Todd, who shared a similar set of values, including a desire to strike out and build a business they could call their own.
But hammocks were a no-fuss piece of equipment that represented happiness to Sarah. Within a few minutes, people could be set up, relaxing, and listening to the gurgle of a stream, ocean waves, or a breeze in the trees. Hammocks were a way to get people enjoying nature fast, easy, and on the cheap.
Hammocks, as a product, also had some clear business advantages: they were relatively simple to manufacture and their compact size made them economical to ship. The fabric color and style options were endless, so they could always be on trend as customer tastes changed. Plus, Wise Owl could produce a lot of hammock accessories to eventually expand its product line.
From the stitching thread counts to the way the seams felt on bare skin (after all, customers might be using a hammock while wearing shorts or a swimsuit), Sarah and Todd left no detail unexamined.
Of the low-cost models, none passed the Sarah test. Too scratchy, too small, poorly made, too difficult to set up. She found one she did love – but it came with a nearly $100 price tag.
They had a mission for their new Amazon ecommerce business: Make the greatest hammock anyone ever owned at half the price.
When she was dreaming up the Wise Owl brand, Sarah created a script for a video ad. In her storyboards, she would proffer a Wise Owl hammock toward the camera and explain to viewers that what she was holding in her hand was not in fact a hammock at all… but happiness. Wise Owl was selling the feeling she had in childhood, what she wanted everyone to experience themselves.
In 2015, Sarah and Todd drew down their savings to place her first purchase order of 200 hammocks. The day the products arrived on her doorstep was another lesson in the challenges of building an Amazon ecommerce business. She opened the box and … the Wise Owl logo was the wrong color. Even worse, the hammocks were stuffed into long and skinny carrying sacks. “They were basically two-foot-long sausages,” she says. She pulled them all apart and paid a local seamstress to fix every logo patch and every sack.
Today, Wise Owl is a booming online Amazon ecommerce business. The hammocks are nearing 40,000 ratings and maintain an impressive average of 4.8. Wise Owl has earned dual Best Seller Badges in both the camping hammocks and patio hammocks categories, while its camping pillows and hammock bug net also have Best Seller Badges. In 2021 alone, the brand sold hundreds of thousands of units in its product line. At the end of 2021, the Camping Hammock was capturing the majority of the market share for camping hammocks on Amazon.
hammocks will launch in the Canadian, UK, and German Amazon markets – a huge expansion for what started as a small Amazon ecommerce business.
, but like many entrepreneurs, she’s not really one to… just rest.

------------------------
Every company has growing pains. To maintain a healthy outlook for your brand's future, don't overlook these key action items.
To strengthen the health of your FBA brand, it can pay to look beyond the bottom line. Have you grown a solid base of happy repeat customers? Or earned an avalanche of 5-star Amazon reviews for your products?  These are the kind of success markers that don’t directly appear on a profit and loss statement — but they can translate into higher customer lifetime value and a stronger FBA brand. In other words, to build an FBA brand with staying power, it helps to consider the big picture of your business.
Here are 4 strategies to think about.
If you’re used to thinking only about profit margin, you may want to start thinking about profit-dollars as well. Your goal should be to improve conversion rates and sales velocity on the products that provide the most bang for the buck in profit-dollars.
Conversion share is the number of times customers bought your product after searching with a given keyword, divided by the total number of times customers bought any product after searching with that same keyword. You want this number to grow over time. It shows you’re capturing a bigger slice of the pie linked to keywords associated with your product.
. The report is a gold mine of insights about your category and your FBA business.
to see which images perform best.
And yes, go for the video. A lot of people don’t incorporate video because it seems too hard or complex. Think of this: we’ve made very professional marketing videos with celebrities that have cost tens of thousands of dollars – and in some scenarios, those convert less than something made in 20 minutes on an iPhone. The lesson? It doesn’t have to be an insane production to be successful. It just needs to connect with customers.
Reviews are the lifeblood of an Amazon ecommerce business. You know this. When faced with an array of similar products, customers often default to the one with the most positive reviews. High-quality reviews start with a high-quality product, of course, but after that, you’ll need to do a little more work to earn your stars.
The work is well worth it. You want to create a moat of positive reviews around your products – an unbridgeable gap between your well-loved products and those of your closest competitors. And to increase your volume of positive reviews, you’ll need to increase your volume of sales. This may mean selling at a loss via a temporary price cut, running Amazon Deals, or increasing ad spending to boost traffic.

Lifelong Online’s co-founders built a powerhouse brand that put a dent in India’s appliance market. The secret to their success? Listen to who matters most – the customer.
market for ecommerce businesses. To be successful, brands must navigate the complexities of India’s delivery infrastructure. They also need to understand the diverse needs of Indian customers, what they want, how they shop, and what they value. In a country of 1.4 billion people, that is extraordinarily difficult.
Which is why the team charged with leading Thrasio’s foray into India are people who know what it takes to build a successful ecommerce brand there.
“It’s our customers, their stories, and their experiences with our products that really inspire me,” says Bharat Kalia, one the three co-founders and CEO of Lifelong Online (now called Lifelong, a Thrasio Company).
Kalia founded Lifelong in 2015 with two partners – Atul Raheja and Varun Grover. Since then, they’ve created more than 100 products, primarily in the kitchen-and-home, and health-and-fitness categories. Air fryers, stoves, stand mixers, treadmills, massagers, hair straighteners: a Lifelong product can be found in about a million homes in more than 500 cities.
The three founders of India-based company Lifelong, a Thrasio company.
But perhaps its biggest triumph is how Lifelong boldly entered the appliance market – a notoriously difficult category dominated by large, entrenched brands. “The products I was using in my home were the same my parents used,” Kalia says.
can be tucked behind a couch or under a bed – the ultimate solution for health-conscious Indians living in space-challenged homes. Today it is one of the best-selling products in the Lifelong line.
Or consider the case of Lifelong’s early version bicycle. Customers were frustrated with how much time and effort it took to put together. “People were saying ‘This is the hardest thing I ever did,’” Kalia says. The next version had just 5 moving parts and came 90% pre-assembled. Now they’re on version 3.
The customer is both king and queen at Lifelong.
A new product launch can involve 2 or 3 interactions with customers in a month, conversations that are coded and analyzed to ensure products are delivering happiness and satisfaction. “We analyze a ton of data and carefully codify our questions before making customer calls,” Kalia says.
This extraordinary openness to feedback goes back to Lifelong’s very first product, an oven toaster griller. In their enthusiasm, Kalia and the founders mounted a product listing before the product was actually ready. “We were super happy to get our first order,” Kalia says. “The problem was we only had a prototype.” He gave the customer a heads-up that the product was a bit of a work in progress – and then packed it up and mailed it across the country to the customer.
in less than prime condition. (“Basically, it was mangled,” Kalia says.) After multiple calls with the customer, Kalia delivered a new model to the customer within 2 weeks. After all that, the customer left Lifelong a positive review.
Lifelong’s employees hard at work building a next generation consumer goods company in India. Thrasio bought a majority share in Lifelong in January.
Lifelong’s goal of reaching every household in a country of 1.4 billion people will require keeping a careful eye on how the market is changing. People aren’t as tied to legacy brands as they once were, Kalia says, and younger generations are more comfortable with ecommerce.

, your gateway to building a better consumer goods company. Every edition, we’ll share stories, insights, and expertise on a topic critical to the industry. This issue: the importance of quality assurance and making sure the products you deliver truly deliver.
Your customers expect the best. Here are 5 steps to build a strong quality assurance program and become more effective at preventing the defective.
Everyone’s been there. You buy a product that you’re excited to use, and then, when you need it, it fails to live up to its claims. Total headache. But for a business owner, one defective item can potentially set off a torrent of torment: a batch that has to be recalled, poor reviews that affect customer acquisition and loyalty, and even additional rounds of production. Fortunately, a strong quality assurance program can save the day, catching defective products before they ever ship to your customers.
If you don’t have a program in place, fear not: Axel Gonzalez has your back. Thrasio’s senior director of quality assurance and sustainability shares 5 steps to get you started.
Take, for example, the premium 10-piece bartender set Thrasio sells through our Mixology & Craft brand. It’s a showpiece with a premium price point. As such, its form can’t have scratches, dirty marks, or any flaws in its shape. Its strainer has to snugly fit inside the shaker so that no liquid leaks, while each piece must also fit in the display stand. And in order to meet Mixology & Craft’s goal of creating delicious cocktails, the shakers need to function as closed vessels that allow you to quickly mix ingredients together while simultaneously chilling the drink. This bartender set needs to bring your dreams of perfect libations to life.
Take some time to think about how form, fit, and function apply to your products. Literally make a list. This is the start of your quality assurance program, how you’ll begin to understand which attributes need to be assessed and tested. Depending on the complexity of your product, it could be a long list. But by clearly identifying what really matters to your products early on, you’ll set yourself up for a smooth operation and strong defense against trouble down the road.
Once you’ve decided what you’re going to test for, you need a resource to guide you through the process. Enter the quality acceptance document.
“The quality acceptance document is essentially the playbook that you will use to carry out your product inspections,” Gonzalez notes.
Picture a playbook for an NFL team. At its most basic, you’ll have your coaching staff and players (or, who’s leading and conducting the testing process), your schedule (how often you test), and your gameplan (how you’ll conduct tests). Instead of using Xs and Os and other visual aids to run your plays, however, you’ll use pictures that help you tell which products will pass a quality check, which will fail, and why. The playbook will also outline the sample sizes you’ll test and define what percentage of defective products will signal the need to reject a whole batch.
Use your written explanation of ideal form, fit, and function to identify what imperfections to test for. These will fall into 1 of 3 categories: minor defect, major defect, or critical defect. For example, a scratch on a cocktail shaker might be considered a minor defect, while a warped shaker that doesn’t fit inside the other shaker could be deemed a critical defect. The amount of defects you find in your sample size will give you an idea about whether you can ship your products, need to do additional testing, or have to – sigh – reject the batch outright.
You can then come up with your own sample sizes and rejection thresholds, but the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) also has a standardized acceptance quality limit (AQL) sampling system for inspection by attributes. The AQL chart can be used to provide information and guidance on inspection levels, rejection thresholds, and sample sizes for individual shipments.
If this seems like a lot, it doesn’t have to be. You don’t want to go it alone when creating a quality acceptance document. Incorporate your supplier into the process.
“It only makes sense that your supplier agrees to everything in the document so that both parties are on the same page in terms of what is and is not acceptable,” Gonzalez says.
By having quality standards clearly laid out and agreed upon ahead of time, you reduce the risk of having a drawn-out dispute with your supplier over an unsatisfactory batch of product.
Striking the right balance on quality assurance can also be tricky. You have to take a bit of a Goldilocks approach with it. Too strict and you run the risk of rejecting too much product, which can lead to delays and stockouts. Too lax and defective products can end up making their way to customers, paving the way for negative reviews. Knowing early on what is realistic for your supplier to achieve from a quality standpoint can save you a lot of time and money down the road.
Oh … and if you’ve never built a quality acceptance document before, no problem.
Templates to help structure your document are available online.
Gonzalez strongly advises against relying on your manufacturer to carry out product inspections on your behalf. “You want an impartial inspector,” he says. “You need to insist on it. Otherwise, you can be left with a supplier who cuts corners when it comes to quality assurance in the hopes of avoiding rejects.” But, Gonzalez adds, there are a few things to keep in mind when looking for a solid third-party inspection company to partner with.
Third-party inspection companies need to be available on short notice. Our partner promises to have an agent on site and ready to conduct an inspection, anywhere in continental Asia, within 24 hours. This kind of flexibility is invaluable, as it minimizes delays across our vast network of suppliers. But even if you only have a few suppliers, if the past 2 years have taught us anything, it’s that unexpected delays and last-minute changes are a fact of life. Knowing that your third-party inspection company has the flexibility to swiftly react to these changes is a huge value-add.
Find an inspection company with top-notch technology platforms that allow you to quickly and easily access all of your inspection reports across your suppliers in real time. That’s especially helpful if you’ve got a lot of suppliers (and thus a lot of inspection reports).
Your third-party inspection company should be aligned with the material in your quality acceptance document. After all, they’ll be the ones carrying out the inspections. In their reports, data should be presented clearly and succinctly, allowing you to make quick, informed decisions on which products are ready to ship. A good inspection report will begin with a summary of the main findings, followed by detailed information to support those assessments. When vetting third-party inspection companies, it’s not a bad idea to ask them for sample reports to get a feel for how they present data.
Schedule inspections as soon as your products come off the line – the sooner the better. Why? That gives you time to course correct if there’s a problem. You don’t want to be caught with insufficient inventory because of extended retesting time frames or full-batch rejections.
There’s no “one size fits all” approach to quality assurance. Every product is unique. Even 2 sellers who sell a similar product may have different ideas about what quality testing should look like. And that’s OK. You’re taking steps that give your products the best chance to arrive on the doorsteps of your customers – exactly how they expect them to be.

We bring products people love to the world.
At Thrasio, we’re reimagining how to make the world’s most-loved products accessible to everyone. So we work with successful sellers, using a deep understanding of rankings, ratings, and reviews – plus supply chain and marketing smarts – to transform the art and science of commerce.
We now feel like stronger business owners because we have a solid model for structuring any future brands we build — and can count on Thrasio to have our backs at any time.
I love how quickly Thrasio can move, how fair they are with their valuation, and how well they aligned with our vision. I returned to Thrasio to sell my second and third businesses.
Thrasio was able to consistently keep revenue strong through 2020 despite the numerous manufacturing, logistic, fulfillment constraints so many sellers faced during COVID. I don’t doubt they handled the account better than I could have myself given the same challenges.
Take a page from Thrasio’s playbook.
Actually, take 50 pages.
Get our book on getting your business ready for sale.
We make sure every Thrasio product delivered to your door delivers. And not just once, but every time, helping you make the most of every moment. It’s how we’ve become one of Amazon’s top 5 sellers.
If you’re looking to sell your Amazon business, we’re excited to work together.

Wir liefern der Welt die beliebtesten Produkte.
Thrasio erweitert den Horizont im Online-Handel. Wir wollen die beliebtesten Produkte aus aller Welt für jeden erreichbar machen. Hierfür arbeiten wir mit erfolgreichen E-Commerce-Unternehmen und Amazon FBA Sellern und nutzen unsere Expertise als Amazon-Aggregator, um ihre Geschäfte zu skalieren. Dabei setzen wir auf erfahrene Amazon-Experten, umfassende SEO-Kenntnisse, Bewertungen und Rezensionen, bewährte Supply-Chain-Prozesse und innovative Marketingstrategien.
Wir sind bessere Unternehmer geworden, denn jetzt haben wir ein gutes Modell für die Entwicklung weiterer Marken – und wir können uns auf die Unterstützung durch Thrasio jederzeit verlassen.
Ich bin beeindruckt, wie schnell Thrasio ans Werk geht, wie fair ihr Angebot war und wie gut sie mit unserer Unternehmensvision übereinstimmen. Ich habe mein zweites und drittes Geschäft ebenfalls an Thrasio verkauft.
Thrasio war in der Lage, über das Jahr 2020 hinweg konstant hohe Umsatzzahlen zu generieren – und das trotz der zahlreichen COVID-Einschränkungen für Produktion, Logistik und Versand. Für mich besteht kein Zweifel, dass sie diesen Herausforderungen besser als ich gewachsen waren.
Unsere Produkte liefern, was wir versprechen. Mit jeder Lieferung wollen wir Ihre Erwartungen nicht nur erfüllen, sondern übertreffen. Auf diese Weise haben wir uns zu einem der Top 5 Amazon-Seller entwickelt.
Gemeinsam bringen wir Ihre Produkte groß raus.
Die Zeit ist reif, Ihr Amazon-Business zu verkaufen? Wir machen Ihnen den Ausstieg leicht.

Our expert leadership team includes Amazon veterans, ecommerce mavens, and successful entrepreneurs at the forefront of rethinking how goods are brought to the world.
Some say fortune favors the brave. Josh and Carlos’ good fortune started when they met while working on a purpose-driven jewelry brand called Bravelets, founded by current Thrasio COO Stephanie Fox. Though the company was initially successful, environmental factors and a lack of resources kept it from growing to its maximum potential. This gave them an idea: What if they could roll up struggling ecommerce companies into one portfolio and use a single set of operators and scalable processes to take them to the next level? Talk about entering a brave new world. Together, they disrupted the 3P marketplace on Amazon and established a category that has gone on to inspire hundreds of competitors.
