.
In a two-way approval, the invoice is automatically matched to the electronic purchase order. Three-way approval requires those documents, plus a receiving report as the third item.

Proper segregation of AP duties is a requirement for solid internal controls. Other objectives include preventing fraud, matching responsibilities, and redefining roles to accommodate automation. All of these will save a company time and money while improving the accounts payable process workflow.
How does automated payment reconciliation work?
(also called bank reconciliation) enables a business to upload an electronic version of a bank statement and automatically reconcile it. The e-version is provided by the bank using “matching rules” that are designated in the system.
Remittance results across all payment methods, entities, and geographies are instantly normalized and built into deep reporting. This leads to faster and more accurate reconciliation and general ledger reporting.
How does B2B payment processing work with AP automation software?
especially critical for operations.
When it comes to B2B payments, the trend points in the direction of ACH transfers as the leading form of payment. Every year, check remittances are steadily decreasing while wire transfers are on the rise. It’s evident that an increasing number of companies are realizing the benefits of AP automation software.
Can AP automation software find duplicate payments?
, look for a system that finds duplicate payments.
. Our system checks from the time the invoice is uploaded, to when it’s approved, even communicating with integrated systems. When a potential duplicate has been found, the system will warn the user with an urgent notification.

with purchase order matching integrated seamlessly with your end-to-end AP workflow. Tipalti’s modern user experience helps drive high process adoption, so buyers and suppliers comply with your PO policy to control company spend.
Tipalti PO Matching is the most modern and intuitive solution I have seen and will help our financial operation gain even more efficiencies, while eliminating costs.
Purchase order processes that work for you and save time. Ensure greater compliance with your company’s purchasing policies. All invoices go through the standard OCR, advanced data extraction, and approval workflows before payment is processed.
Built for 2-way and 3-way matching, Tipalti provides the flexibility you need to eliminate overspending. Even if an invoice is auto-matched, you still have the option to require additional approvals before payment is processed.
Want even more flexibility? Rather than manually reviewing all mismatches between invoices, purchase orders, and receiving reports, you can create tolerance thresholds based on amounts or percentages and on the bill or line level, so an invoice is still considered “matched” if it’s within the threshold.
Exception reconciliation has never been easier or more intuitive. Tipalti shortens cycle time from invoice receipt to payment and maximizing discount opportunities.
Exception approvals on purchase orders are easy. Any exceptions that exceed established thresholds can be sent for immediate approval through email and approved or contested with a single click.
, Tipalti syncs POs and GRNs. Integrations are bi-directional, so PO statuses are automatically updated in ERP, too, such as the amount billed and if it’s complete or partial payment. Tipalti processes operating expenses and fixed assets the same way for matching, so there’s no change to the workflow. You get automated syncing and matching that works for your business.
